"This shirt is really nice. Ordered a men’s small for fit and it is spot on. The feel is almost a silky finish and it is incredibly soft. Washed up very nicely and is a true, crisp white. This is a slim fit and not see thru in any way. Didn’t dry with any wrinkles and the button is for decoration only. The shirt isn’t boxy and didn’t shrink or mishape in any way. I’m very happy with this purchase. This shirt is stylish and stretchy. I love the modern neckline and my husband likes the stretch of the material. It is a slim fit so I ordered one size up and it is perfect! Even if you order your ""true size"" the material is stretchy and accommodating. Breathable and comfortable, white goes with everything!. I highly recommend this shirt! I'll start off with it not being that slim fitting. I wear m slim and this is too loose. I'd size down if you still want the shirt. This shirt is so soft and comfortable! It fits as expected, maybe a tiny bit on the small side but it is stretchy so the actual fit is perfect! I bought it for my husband who was skeptical about me buying him a shirt on Amazon at first, but after trying it on and wearing it, he wants me to buy several more so he can wear them as undershirts! This shirt is so soft and comfortable!! I ordered a medium and it fit my husband perfectly. After a machine wash, the size remained the same and did not shrink like most clothes. You can wear this shirt casual or dress it up with some nice slacks. I am very satisfied with this shirt and I would suggest it to others!! The quality of this material is soft and luxurious. It feels fabulous against my skin. Being that it's white, it will match just about everything. I've had no trouble getting stains out of this shirt. It's my go-to shirt for just about every outfit. Other than it runs a little small, this is a great tee!  The fabric is soft and really comfortable and the way it fits and looks are great!  Just order up a size. (Hubby wears a large, got him an XL) Very nice white tee!!! Way better then expected. Very cool and unique style that’s a perfect fitted cut. The material is also thick  which is nice for a white shirt. I’m 6’1” about 215 in pretty good shape and it looks amazing on. Highly recommend",1,1
"Thanks for the impromptu meetup and good service. Item true to pictures😀 Seems too big on me despite getting my regular size, but it's still looks really pretty on me.  Totally love it !! 🙆🏻 Fast delivery and nicely wrapped. Shoes in good condition and comfy. Bought a few pairs for xmas. Fast replies from seller. Thumbs up.",1,1
"Wow, good thing I didn't read reviews this time and ordered my usual size (xs). I wear VS, pink, target's xs. CK small (just because they don't have xs and they are too big for me)  I received today and tried them on. They were like VS's small or even medium. Difinetely positively so much bigger than VS's xs!! I don't know if it's only xs, but if you wear VS's small size, order their xs size! I originally ordred the XL based on some of the other reviews saying they ran a bit on the small side.  For me at least, the size chart is spot on with most of the other brands I have.  Other than the little hiccup in size, I love these underwear!  Never thought I'd say that about panties from a website, but then I never thought I'd be ordering them online in the first place lol.  I'll be ordering more when the time comes. As a modern woman who likes to let my booty pop in any given outfit I wear, and doesn't want said booty to be marred by unsightly VPL, I wear a lot of thongs. Thongs are generally seen as inherently uncomfortable, and we can all agree that the classic flossy, barely-there, g-string type ones especially such and are more suitable for garroting whoever invented them than they are for actual wear. These thongs are the polar opposite. The front has reasonable coverage and they're cut generously all over so that you don't get a gross sausage effect from where the sides cut into your hips. Also, the cotton fabric's breathability is a must for healthy lady bits. These thongs keep my booty looking fine and my bits just as comfortable as the most embarrassing granny panties, even at the gym. Two thumbs up from me, and another two thumbs enthusiastically up from my spouse as well! This is the second time I've bought these. The first ones I bought were perfect! I love that they are cotton and they fit great. So I decided to order more. I immediately took them out of the packaging and washed them. They ended up being the right size xxl on the tag but I'd say maybe 3/4 were a medium in reality. I can't even wear them. So to sum this up- buyer beware, these are awesome but inconsistent in sizing. I love these underwear. They fit perfectly as expected (ordered the size I normally wear when purchased at the store) and they are so soft. While the fancy, lacy undies are pretty to look at, most are not comfortable for everyday wear. These are. I will be ordering more. I did not receive 2 of any one color; each pair were a different color. I have washed and dried them and it did not affect the size or shape. Very pleased with purchase and would recommend. I was really happy to receive these thongs.  I've used Willow Bay for thr last 15 years, then they stopped making them.  YIKES!  I have a bitt of a tummy, so it was nice to find these didn't bind me in the middle of my tummy or were too long to pull up to my natural waist.  The colors are cheerful, although it would be nice if these offered a pack od nude color to match my bras.  Or if they threw in some nude, some white so I could match them to my bras.  But overall they were comfortable and as low as they ride, they didn't bunch up or roll dowwn.  I'm just trying to find my new brand, as I am brand loyal....and I think I may have found it.  Very happy! Great thongs, pretty comfortable. So far they have been great. Only issue I had was one pair has some sort of writing stained on the fabric. Nice material for great. However, major quality control issues! They fall apart after just a few washes.  I bought 2 set. Few months later, most have benn thrown in trash because they fell apart at the seams. So disappointed.",1,1
"I'm loving these.  They look great (in a casual way) and of course the best part is comfort.  I found them surprisingly light.  The sole is more substantial than I expected.  And I was prepared for a total absence of arch support, BUT, to my pleasant surprise I found that the cushiony insole does form to the foot enough to provide some meaningful arch support. These things so dank! Not the dark and damp cellar kind of dank, more like the kind of dank you feel when you find that beachside taco stand that wraps burritos in a quesadilla and still put cheese on top. I think if you're seriously considering these Chiba's, you'll completely understand what I'm saying! If you need to read more, I offer the rest of my review: First impression; they felt very cheap. I felt the slippery bottom like a cheap foam sandal, and the look was less than impressive... but then I put them on. My opinion changed immensely. These things are comfortable. Some people complain about no arch support... Sandals don't have arch support, so that's irrelevant. I wear standard leather thong sandals, and these are a compliment to those. They are comfortable, I can walk, drive, run, relax in them. The look has grown on me, and they don't feel cheap when I walk in comfort. They are definitely more comfortable to walk about in, than thong sandals, and much less heavy than leather thong sandals. I am a size 10 US, sometimes a size 10 1/2 US for shoes. I never have to buy 11, except for when I buy Sanuks. Make sure to size up if you *ever* have to buy half sizes. Was scared at first I wear a size 13 show so I ordered size 13 and when I first put them on they were really tight but they broke in now and fit perfect . I have wide feet too and they couldn't fit any better. Great shoes. I slip them on with no socks when I'm running a quick errand . Nice comfy shoe.  A little pricey for what it is--like slippers with a foam sole.  Otherwise, nice beatnik styling and it is comfy.  The enlarged sole takes some getting used to--the front lip tends to catch on the ground.  It is a very comfortable walking shoe though.  Walked during a trip to Toronto recently and walked probably 25 miles over 3 days.  Plenty comfy.  I like this style because the rear has a rolled edge.",1,1
"Just as expected, device is small and ultra light.  i love that it has 3 different mode of detections,  i like the vibrate mode, and there is a signal strength indicator to direct you to the source of hidden cam.  really great tool. Works great for wireless devices. For the price I recommend this to anyone that needs to sweep for wireless devices.",1,1

"The boots are just like the picture which is a big relief when ordering online. The color of these boots are beautiful and look more than they are worth and the gold buckles and zipper is the cherry on top. These may not fit well for people with big calves, it was a close fit for me as I have semi big calves. Maybe without jeans they'd fit easier but they look so stylish with jeans. It has padding inside around the leg so it'll certainly keep you warm in the winter. At first they were tight like most shoes and can rub the pinky toe raw without socks but if you use a shoe stretcher or just wear them they will break in nicely. I recommend using thick socks until then. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I just received these boots today and like any good amazon purchaser I ripped open the box and instantly put them all. Now I expected them to fit a little small (call me crazy but I'm little so I think things look better on me if they are a little smaller than bigger) so when I say they fit as expected, yes they are a little small. I normally wear a size 6 in all shoes and these kind of rub my big toe at the tip. If there are half sizes I would have bought that but I was scared a 7 would be to big. The struggle. But with that being said they are spacious on the sides width wise (again for my little feet) so no rubbing on the sides. Okay so I received these boots today & for those of you who are weird about packaging .. It was good I guess? I absolutely love these boots! Although, they are a little tight in the calves, which is expected with my large calves, I still wear them all the time! I purchased the Forever Link Women’s MANGO-21 boots in tan, and what I received in the mail was nothing short of a hilarious insult to Amazon customers. It’s hard to detail exactly what happened here, but I’ll try...upon opening the box, I was greeted with a musty foot funk that should’ve caused me to burn the package in my backyard. Instead of taping the box back up and calling the Department of Homeland Security to report a suspicious package, I further investigated and overflowed my nightmare fuel tank in the process. The shoes in the box were neither the model or color I ordered, but that was the least of my issues. This particular pair looks like they’ve been through a war. The heel sole is completely worn through the rubber, like it’s been gnawed off by thousands of hungry mountain leeches. The metallic buckles are rusted green as if they’ve been tied to a ocean buoy and battered by salty waves for decades. The leather has been distressed like the face of that lady who spent half of her yearly income to put a tanning bed in her kitchen. And the smell? Pickled eggs in the rotted pantry of a forgotten Cold War bunker. I can’t get that stink out of my front room. The vendor that I purchased these from, Fashion Unique, has some explaining to do. Specifically, why they sent me the well-loved boots of a veteran hobo. Please make this right! I purchased these on October 24th and they've already fallen apart. The bottom of the show is completely coming off (see photo). The fit and softness inside the boot is great but I wish they had a longer life than 2 months! Cute boots, and made well as far as I can tell.  I just got them today so time will tell with how well they stand up to wear.  I'm reviewing today on the super fast shipping and the fit.  I wear an 8 in every single shoe that I own, so I can accurately say these run a tad small.  I can wear them with a thin sock but they don't have much toe room. Go up a half size and they should fit fine. I love these boots. I can't wait to wear them this winter. I normally wear an 8 so I bought an 8 1/2 . They fit perfectly. I bought these because I found the same ones in my daughter's size. I can't wait  to dress alike.",1,1

"I love these Nylon Braided Cables from SyncWire! There are a lot of iPhone cable knock offs out there but there aren't many that fit and work as well as this one. Okay, these are some sturdy cables for your iPhone. I've ordered several, and have them all over my house. ( And in my travel bag, I'm a flight attendant) They are long and perfect. And, c'mon! They have a lifetime warranty! I had a little funny thing happen. We got a new puppy and it turns out she likes to CHEW OUR PHONE CORDS:(, she chewed through 2 of the cords, so I ordered more. The company had just emailed me asking how I liked their product, and me being funny, thought I'd ask if their warranty covered ""puppies chewing through their cords"". GUESS WHAT?? They do! The sent me 4 more.  WOW. That is some customer service thats unheard of these days.  Hopefully this review will help you make up your mind! Charging cables are important in our lives!  We have to have them! I have ordered and attempted to use several non-branded chargers in the past, only to find them completely inferior.  They overheated, wouldn't charge, cables ripped, etc.  This is the first one that has worked perfectly!  For the price, this product cannot be beat!  Buying more to have on hand for our Ipads and Iphones! Great product, great seller! I had bought this in August, and early September it had randomly stopped working. I then called customer service to redeem the lifetime warranty. The replied very fast and sent a new cable. The feel of the cable itself is amazing. The product is very high quality. If you are tired of having to replace these over and over again, then get this one, you will not regret it :) I've owned two of these for about 5 months. Both cables worked consistently. They are not indestructible, however. One developed the common fraying issue on the phone jack end that we have all experienced with apple and other after-market charge cable brands. I don't fault the cable quality. Unless you invest in a 'bomb proof' cable, engineered specifically for this issue, which are usually bulky and stiff, you have a trade-off in the durability of any cable. Wow. AMAZING wire. I've gone through 3 in the last month of crappy off brand ones, you know those without the LIFETIME warranty and for a cheap buck. But I decided I did not want to live a cheapo's life anymore and I splurged on an oh-so-expensive charger-- this one.",1,1
"I wasn't sure about this tee when I was ordering it but I actually really like it!! I needed a new gym shirt and this one is perfect. The material is very stretchy and SO comfortable. I love the way it feels. It's a bold shirt but I think it works great as a casual tee around the house and a gym tee! For reference, I'm 5'4"" and about 120 lbs. Classy and pretty black t-shirt! I didn’t really think this shirt is my style but when I wore it, I ended up loving it. The shirt is super comfortable. The material is thick and good quality. I love it! I will wear it a lot. The size I am wearing is a “S”. Loved his shirt a lot it is so comfy and soft! 5 Start to this!! I like the fabric of this top it fits really soft and it fits tts. Also the colors are really vibrant. This shirt is super cute and very comfy! Great material as well. Really love it!",1,1

"I've owned a steam cleaner for over 20 years ever since I got my first puppy so I know a thing or 2 about steam cleaning and also how much some of these solutions cost. I will use a vinegar and water in my machine if i have to and it work better than some of this overpriced junk at the store. NOW let me get to this stuff. I just bought a new steam cleaner and decided to try this cleaner with it. This stuff is concentrated. Let me addtess a few things other have complained about. One is that your carpets smell fresh and look great immediately after but then seem to get dirty within a few days. That is because you need to run warm to hot water over the treated carpet a few times to remove the soap buildup or your carpets will be crunchy. That being said it gets the pet stains and funky odors out. I'm also very frugal so I was hesitant to order this stuff but it lasted a year and I made sure to order the exact same thing again because it's magic crack for your carpets. More effective than anything I've found for removing dog pee stains on my living room carpet (which is off-white). This product works great for my carpets, but I was shocked at how big these bottles are!  I ordered 2 at the same time, and when the Amazon driver was bringing the box to my door you could see he was carrying a lot of weight!  I should have enough product to last me quite a while, and while these are big bottles, they are a great value when compared to what I paid at a local retailer. My hoover carpet shampooer came with a sample of this detergent and it made my whole house smell so good that I had to buy a large replacement bottle. About 800 square feet of my 2000 square foot home is carpet and this bottle cleaned all the carpets with more detergent to spare. I used this for an apartment carpet and so far I can't complain. It doesn't leave a strong smell which I was concerned about. I don't have other products to compare or reference, but it worked well for my needs. This is a strong floor cleaner gets the deep down spots out, I had jeans on when I used this cleaner and when my jeans contacted the wet floor it took the color out, so you know what it did to the spots. This cleaner is wonderful! Cleans very well and the smell is not over powering like other shampoos. It's a very nice soft clean smell perfect if you have babies or toddlers with sensitive noses. Great price even compared to the big box stores. But it's the same great product. Hoover never fails to clean my area rugs and carpeted areas wonderfully and the one in the red bottle leaves a clean scent that's not overpowering.",1,1

"I love this shirt, size as expected (fit really well). I also like the material, soft and comfortable. I washed and dried it on low and it did not shrink, still looks new. This t-shirt is nice and soft. It fits perfectly. I would give it 10 stars if possible. I love how it fits...long and loose!  I love how it feels and how it looks on me.  I may buy it again in a different color. I was copying a Kate Middleton style and this was perfect for what I was trying to achieve. Its a cute shirt So cute, soft and stretchy. My wife received many compliments on this top.  Medium fit as expected. Love it. Wear it all the time! If it were machine wash and dry, I'd give it five stars. Love the feel and fit.",1,1
"My grandfather has dementia and regular belts can frustrate him and, often, don't hold up well. This belt helps him because it's elastic, he doesn't have to necessarily undo it to be able to get it off (ie: can push it, and his pants, down). It also gives a better fit, due to there being almost no limits to how he can adjust it. It -is- a little hard to get in and out of the pant loops, sometimes, but it's working much better than his old ones (most of which were yanked to pieces). For the price that I paid...I have to say that this is quite well made, and I think it's going to stand up way better than the usual LEATHER braided belts that seem to fall apart after a year. Because it is STRETCHY, you may have to hike your pants back up a few times a day if you do a lot of bending ... but for just casual CASUALNESS.... the belt is PRETTY DECENT and surprisingly sturdy. Black buckle was unique - can dress it up or down. Size was good. Cheap and great for price. It has a very comfortable fit. Don't have prime, but it came in two days, and I live in Alaska. There's no excuse for shipping to take two weeks. 10/10 would buy again. Arrived and fit as described. Good amount of the stretch, not too tight nor too loose. Good material quality and color. Nice  buckle. Great value for the price. It’s nice. Simple. All good. Love it",1,1
"If you love skulls or snakes this is a ring for you. The opening is much smaller than it appears in the picture which I personally prefer. The ring is very heavy. It is made well and will not break easily. This could be for either gender and is sized exactly right. The details in the faces are amazing. This is costume jewelry so I would take precautions such as not wearing it to the pool , and things of that nature. This is a very unique and punk style ring. I love the design of the skull. They're sized accurately and the 14K gold plate keeps the ring from turning your finger green. It came in a nice gift box. It’s pretty good in my opinion. Although it’s made out of a weakish metal since you can “mold” the ring to your actual finger size, since the ring doesn’t actually connects. But it’s good! looks amazing!",1,1

"This set was very nice. The non-stick coating has remained in tact. The pots cook very nicely. I purchase silicone kitchen tools to use with the pots to prevent scratching of the non-stick coating. I also have cook in T-Fal cookware in the past and this Brentwood set cook just as well as T-Fal did. The Brentwood set is a lot cheaper. I have nothing but positive feedback for this product. To be clear, you get 3 saucepans, 1 frypan and 3 lids.  The frypan is a good size IMO, the smaller saucepan is a size for boiling milk if that floats your boats, or cooking instant noodles etc.  The large one is a size for boiling whole potatoes and cooking pasta for four, etc. At first I was happy with this set, but after only a few uses the nonstick coating began to come off the saucepans and dutch oven. The frying pan seems to be doing ok for some reason but I'll be replacing it anyway after seeing how the other pieces in the set performed. I suggest avoiding this product and saving up for a higher quality set. This cookware is terrible. After just a couple months of use, if that, the inside coating began to chip off. Waste of money. great I was worried because the price was very reasonable, but the pans are very nice.  I especially like the glass lid.",1,1
"My four year old daughter picked these out from a selection of boots I showed her. (I based my choices on good reviews, she based her choice on PINK AND SPARKLY.) I admit I was hesitant to get these at first because at the time I was looking for boots, most reviews only mentioned ""cute"", whereas I am more concerned with functionality, but I figured if the boots were terrible there would have been comments about it. So I went for them! (A lot of reviews have been added since then about how warm they are. These really are awesome!) Really good boots for a great price. Happy with my purchase Great boots for bitter cold single digit temperature. Waterproof a must! Tread keeps you from slipping. Great price. They for like they should. I read reviews sellers notes saying they ran small and ordered a size larger. Size larger is too large! These boots are sized right on for children. I normally dont buy shoes online because I worry that they wont fit and then you have to ship them back which can be a pain and esp if you really need them which was the case with these winter boots for my daughter. Every store was sold out in our area and seeing its winter she needed boots badly so I gave in and started lookin and we liked these and I want to give credit when its due. They had all the measurements so you could compare with your child or yourself whoever you are shopping for which we did and they fit just as they where supposed so there info is quite correct. They also are so very well made warm and water proof I am so pleased with this item and would encourage others to not be worried about buying this product I had my eye on these boots for a while, They were in my cart for a while. I bought these for my 5 year old. She loves outdoors..rain, sleet, snow; so it was a no brainier that she needed snow boots. She was wearing a pair if Crocs rain boots, she went out to play in the snow one day and she said her feet were cold. So, I was about to click order on my cart and her size were no longer available. 😔😔 So I searched for other and didn't like any others as much. I started reading the reviews and found that they ran small 👌👌.. from the reviews you should order at least 2 sizes bigger. My daughter wears a 13 or 1 depending on the shoe, so I ordered a size 2. PERFECT FIT. The are a little big, but it gives her a little room for thicker socks if needed. The are cute and durable and warm per her. She loves them and puts them on everyday. The tab that holds the elastic lace broke about 5 minutes into sledding. Exchanges are impossible with this company. I had to buy a new pair first and then send the broken ones back to get a refund. I also lost the lightening deal and had to pay full price which aggravates me. My 10 year old wore these boots a few times during a big snowstorm to play in the snow - said his feet stayed dry and toasty.  Also wore them to school during a 20 min walk and was able to do the walk comfortably - again, his feet remained dry.  Perfect snow boots and they look a little more fashionable than typical snow boots in this price range, especially in the blue. My 8 year old daughter loves the look and fit of these boots.  They are super cute! She usually wears a 12 or 13 so I bought a size 1 to leave room to grow.  They fit really well. So maybe they run a bit small?",1,1
"Works well enough, and allows all of the 90 MB/s or so I can get from my WD Scorpio Black 750 GB drive.  In my more ""unusual"" configuration, I use the USB ports to power two SATA 3 SSDs I do all my major FCPX video creation and editing using an Akitio Thunderbolt adapter.  Since it was SATA to eSATA, I still needed to power the drives.  So, it's all bus-powered on my early 2015 MacBook Pro 13"" and they work great.  The pictures show the benchmarks I got through the USB 3.0 port to the old school spinning HDD, and the other pictures have the Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless earphones from another review highlighting USB 3.0 interference issues. My Mac Mini's hard drive was dying so I bought an internal Western Digital WD7500BPVX (which is awesome by way, linked below) to replace the OS drive. Lazy as I am, the internal drive sat bare on top of my Mac Mini at my desk for six months connected with a USB 3.0 to SATA cable, which can not be good for the drive. Still being lazy, I saw this product and with such a good price point, decided to check it out. It took 2 minutes to install and works perfectly. The three USB ports in the front is very convenient to attach any peripherals. Anyways, thumbs up! Edit: If you want to use this UNITEK enclosure you must take into account that it needs at least a 1m USB 3.0 cable. Otherwise, if you use, for example, a 30cm cable you may get interference with the WiFi integrated antenna and it drops your internet connection. It's weird, but that's the way it is if you use it with a laptop. Picked up this enclosure for two reasons, the first was to house the HD I use to store my archive of e-books and FLAC music library. Secondly, was to use it as a mini-hub, as the three-additional standard USB ports are desperately needed on any of the new MacBook Pro's that only have four USB-C ports. I have daisy-chained my TimeMachine HD, as well as an older 7200RPM HD that I store old family photos and home-videos. I have had the drive for two-weeks so far, and I have no complaints whatsoever. I use this as an external drive enclosure for my Mac Mini and it works very well. As an added benefit it adds some USB ports to the Mac The independent power is good for power hungry disks (especially hybrids) which I have observed disconnect randomly from the Mini--but not with this enclosure. This product works as promised.  I was able to take my old SSD laptop hard drive, install it in this enclosure and voila, I now had a backup SSD external drive for additional storage.  It was very easy to use.  Basically just plug and play.  I've found the extra USB ports on the device handy as well as my laptop only has 3 USB 3 ports, both of which I use. This is an excellent product, this is not the first time a purchase it, I already own 7 and no one has failed me,",1,1
"Like them so far. I ordered a  14/16 to allowance shrinkage once washed even tho I only hang dry our sons shirts. My son is almost 12 and about an inch under 5 ft and 87lbs of lean-ness.  Quality seems good, nice fit. True test will be once washed a few times! This is a good quality shirt. Not the least bit thin and the color has held up over quite a few washings. I will be looking at getting some more for my grandkids in the near future. This is so frustrating. The ash pictures looks to be like a heather grey color. I ordered it, and needed to return it. the listing pictures colors are way off... I printed my return label and shipped it, and it was returned to me with a note for additional postage. Thought there was FREE RETURNS?! Nope, not with this seller apparently!! Not happy, at all. Perfect Fit .  Good quality fabric.  Feels comfortable.  This T-shirt survived several washing and drying cycles.  No shrinkage, nor any deterioration to color or overall condition of this shirt has been observed.  Still as good as new. A bit bigger than expected, but held up well being laundered. I applied an iron on transfer and it has held up beautifully on this shirt! Can't go wrong with the Gildan brand.Bought 3 of these for my sons soccer 3 vs 3 tournament. We had them screen printed. They fit as per the size your child typically wears. It is a great inexpensive t-shirt. Very well made and of good material. We will continue to purchase these shirts for the rest of our plain t-shirt needs. Bought a generic gray t-shirt for my son's PE. The school issued Gildan of the same size is bigger than this one. Surprised that there is so much variability for the same brand but made at different places. Looks okay and it is low cost. So, just fine I usually buy boys XL at Walmart or JCPenney and they fit the same. This one is more like XXL - too big. It was also stated that they are ""heavy"" cotton. They are not very thick. Walmart's are thicker.",1,1

"Usually... I'd say that these are just for anyone who wants a mobile lvm/RAID setup, expanded storage, dual drives, etc. but as of Windows 10, I'm clearly seeing a very real usage for them as a free software hobbyist. As of today, if you're *serious* about dual or triple-booting your PC, and aren't going to keep Windows 7 (or 8), but use 10 instead (out since 2015 now), I'd urge to *not* split up the internal/single drive alone. Windows 10 updates have overwritten my bootloader several times now since release, and if you *need* Windows for work, 10 should be best left to itself. Instead, I'd recommend to install a BSD, Haiku, or Linux to the secondary drive using this device so that both systems (or more) can live in peace in their own biomes. But who am I to impose one usage out of the many someone could buy these for? Maybe it's to store music, files, games, etc. or the other top uses. For whatever purpose, I can say these work! Purchased to install in a Lenovo Ideapad 110 laptop. Fits snugly. The item kind of fit after I peeled the stickers off the top and bottom the rest of the way. The partially peeled off when I inserted it into the lap top. Product was not new,  [New (3) from $7.88] The unit was used. Had scratches on top and bottom of the case.  It did not work with my Son's laptop, an HP Elitebook 8440P.  It was also tested on a Toshiba Satellite notebook and also, did not work.  The unit would have to be engineered somehow so that the unit will not fall out of a laptop if turned on its side.  It can just fall out with little effort.  The unit was protected in bubble wrap, the was no documentation supplied. I will not say that it is the sellers fault for carrying such a product. I will NOT recommend to buy this. Worked perfectly with my old Dell Latitude E6510. Popped out the old DVD drive and put this one in with a 1TB HDD. System picked it up right away with no problems. Great HDD caddy for an awesome price! Work intermittently, Windows goes to blue screen frequently using this caddy, no problem using another brand caddy with same HDD. Worked great in my old MSI A6000 laptop.  Allowed me to put a SSD in the motherboard and the original HD in the CD spot so I could keep all my files.  A little hard to get out once installed since there is no pull tab, but not a big deal for me.  Pretty scary to see CD's go out of style. Good product, fast shipping and all at a good price.",1,1

"Being Latina with naturally dark brown hair and trying to maintain a nice blonde tone is always hard! For the past year I've slowly transitioned from jet black hair that I dyed myself to this nice honey blonde color(: anyways My hair stylist only uses joico products and I was so excited to try this purple shampoo. My problem with my hair has always been that even after a few days of getting my hair done it would turn into a very yellow brassy tone like on the left side of the picture. After using joicos shampoo my hair now looks less yellow brassy and more honey blonde as u can see on the right side. It's not platinum blonde because my hair hasn't lifted that high and I don't want that blonde of a hair anyways. But anywhom it did make a tremendous difference and I totally reccoment this to everyone especially to those with naturally dark hair and who struggle with very brassy looking hair like I do. Now every time I use it which is 1 every 2 weeks I look like I went to the salon to get my hair done💜 love joico products💜 Wonderful product will always use now! Took out all the brassy tones and I only bleached my hair once btw!! Bleached for a half hour on dyed black hair! Did this shampoo 4 times total now for 15 min and in a 3 week period. On damp hair and made sure to condition after w 3 min miracle by Aussie This stuff is amazing! I bought the blue and the purple and mixed them together for best results. As you can see in the before and after pic, it really pulled the yellow out and lightened my hair! I just let it sit while I wash my face and that is usually long enough to do the trick :) Great for toning down the brassy yellow in highlighted hair. Warning!!! It will stain your white bathtub, be sure to rinse your tub when you are finished! This shampoo is just okay. I’ve always used purple shampoo in the past but wasn’t happy with the lightening results. This shampoo is for brown highlighted hair. It does take away some orange tones, but it will not solve any problems. This is a very temporary fix, and is great to use in between salon visits to maintain toner on highlighted hair. Photo shown is after using blue shampoo! Not so brassy but still some visable. Used to this blue shampoo to cancel out brassiness out of hair in between toning. It works really well but just be sure to use a good quality conditioner afterwards. I recommend using a shower cap over your head once you lather it on - while you're waiting keep a washcloth handy and be sure to rinse your hands as you wait because this stuff is powerful and it can stain your hands if you leave it on too long. However I have not had a problem at all with it staining my scalp. A great product and will order again. Can't really tell if it helps or not, maybe it does but I don't wanna use it like I should to see. It burns my eyes, not like I got shampoo in my eyes like my hair is rinsed and the shampoo appears to be off but the water run off from my head still manages to agitate my eyes. And worse than that I don't feel clean. It doesn't really suds up like you'd expect shampoo too so you end up having to use a lot of it, and I have a pixie! But mostly I just feel like I come out of the shower and my hair feels like it got dried out badly but my scalp still feels oily. Tell me how that works? >.> BEST purple shampoo out there. I recommend this to everyone that asks how I keep my blonde so blonde and not brassy!",1,1
"Good product quality, great offer! Fast response..",1,1
"Looks exactly like picture and the description. This set looks great. It is not thick walled, you will have to pay a lot more for thick walled pots and pans. It was packaged well, nothing was broken or damaged. I like the clear glass lids, so I can see what it going on with the food without having to lift the lid. If you cook everyday you should probably spend more on a higher quality set, but this set is going to be used in a vacation rental so it won't be used all the time. It looks better than I expected. The largest pot was smaller than I thought it would be but that is my fault for not being able to visualize the size given in quarts, but still adequate if a person was going to boil spaghetti for 2-3 people. It was important for me that they be able to be put in the dishwasher, because I know people staying at the rental will more than likely wash them in the dishwasher.  As far as spotting after washing, I've never had a set that doesn't develop some spots.  It doesn't effect how well they perform so I don't consider it a defect. Overall, I'm glad I chose this set, it doesn't look cheap like some of the other sets in this price range. Let's get a few things out of the way, this set is very thin, and it is not non-stick. Now, that being said, it heats up well, evenly, and cooks just fine. The only reason I will rate them a  4 is because of how thin they are. This is clearly a set not meant to last a lifetime; however, you can cook everything you want on it. One upside to them not being non-stick is that you can use steel wool to scrub the bottom of the pans if anything gets caked on. This set does everything it is supposed to do. I thought I was getting such a great deal on pots and pans but I guess as the saying goes, you get what you paid for. After only the second use of the skillet, the bacon burned into the metal of the pan and it's not something you can scrub clean. The pots and pans also get extremely hot when trying to use - Even when you are just doing something simple like making soup you have to use a pot holder. The pans will scorch and stain if the heat is too high. And the brownish stains will not come out. (unless someone has a cleaning solution I don't know about.) So, be mindful to keep heat low on these. Nice clean polished stainless steel , well made with good heat resistant handles that are very well designed to give control. Very easy to clean I love it. I have cooked with a few times, haven't had a problem with scorching or burning. It is very light. Only negative is the handles get very warm, other than that great item for the price. I have no idea what product these 5 star reviews are using. This cookware set is not useful for anything other than decoration or boiling water. Each pan is ruined after one use, no matter how much oil or nonstick spray you use. I've only used this set to cook ground beef and scramble an egg and each pan was ruined afterward. I would give it zero stars if I could!",1,1

"The buckle does not fit through the belt loops in any normal size jeans, Carhartt's, or military issue trousers. Fantastic materials and buckle/clip.

"I am a HUGE fan of Kind bars, and these I have to fight my daughter for!  I  am never disappointed in the flavor, the size or the product.  Each and every bar comes individually packaged and tasting perfect. I  have purchased several different flavors to send to my children in their ""care packages"", and none of them have ever told me to stop including them!  My only problem is making sure that I send them to my kids and not keep them for myself! I  love that they have gluten free options since my youngest daughter is gluten intolerant and always complaining that there's nothing for her to eat!  Keep up the great work Kind bars - you have a fan for life!!! Have fallen in love with these bars. A filling snack and easy to take with you. The candy bar shape with chocolate are excellent but all have almonds which are rock hard and I can't eat. They are ok for a granola bar. There is a lot going on in 1 bar. They are many different flavors. They are to hard for my liking, I like a more chewy granola. They are super messy. When you eat them they feel like you are eating pop rocks. They do however fill you up and keep you satisfied for awhile. Wow. These were hands down some of the best (if not the best) snack bars I've ever had. I would definitely buy this flavor again. They were just the right size and tasted amazing. Love the chew. Good flavor. Hits the spot. Gluten free! Tastes like what I imagine bird food would taste like. I buy these for my house and also to tuck into the ""care packages"" of treats and teas I send to my kids in Guam. This is probably my most favorite Kind product. It has a light hint of vanilla and blueberries and it is very delicious! I'm so glad I ordered it, will definitely buy again.",1,1
"Great price for a shirt I will only wear on St Patty's...received many compliments on it when I wore it for the occasion. cute shirt Purchased XL and the size seems more like a medium at best.

Fits well and is a good St' Paddy's day idea. Love it. Perfect fit. Very soft. Great for Saint Pats Day I bought this shirt for my daughter in law. She's a Jameson girl. She loved this t shirt.

"These shoes are super comfortable and pretty. I really like them may order more in other colors. The color is very pretty. They are slightly small but not uncomfortably so. I love these flats, it's amazing!! I wear a size 6.5 and bought the 7. It fits perfectly. The leather is super soft. I can live in them, I will probably buy another pair in another color. One bad thing tho, the shoe cushion does lift up cause I wear it w/o socks, but I used double sided tape and it does the job. I am in LOVE with these shoes! I have them in navy but plan to order the rainbow of colors. I wear them with my scrubs to work, I can walk in these shoes for 12-18 hours with no aches or hurting feet. I can't even say that for my $160 Alegria nursing shoes! I love these shoes, very comfortable and soft. Didn't expect to like them so much. I just wish there was an option where the soling was white as well, is there? Nice shoe though...update! I wore the shoe once and some of the threading has already begun to loosen, it's still a good shoe, really comfortable however I'm not sure if it'll hold up for a long time. I got my true size 8 and they fit perfectly. I had ordered similar ones in a 8.5 and they were too loose. Love these! The no laces is the best option cuz my other ones laces were always coming untied. So comfortable and cushioned. Best shoe! I wear them barefoot and no smell. No sweat. At first just some dye transfer to my foot but no biggie. It washed off. Buy these if you walk a lot. I wear these to Busch gardens every week. I own red and blue. I plan on black and khaki next! These shoes are wonderfully comfortable! I’m a size 8 and ordered an 8. I wear these with no socks. They have plenty of room, but aren’t falling off my feet. I’m on my feet all day and have bad knees. These feel great!!! Nothing rubs my foot in any spot. The insoles have a leather feel, with foam on the underside. I don’t think the foam will last very long, but I’ll just replace the insoles at that time. Worth the money, for sure! I love these little loafers, they look great on, very neat and soft.  So comfy!!!  Only thing is I think they are about a half size smaller than typical US sizing.  They don't do a half size in my size but they are so cute that I intend to keep them.  However,  if they don't stretch I'm quite sure my toenail may poke through!  I have let the seller know in the hope that they put a note on the description.  I wanted to buy three or four more in different colors but the sizing issue prevents that. I'm happy to take a chance with one ... but not 5 pairs! I love these shoes and the price of them.  I would purchase them again but would get at least one-half size smaller. They run big and even with heavy socks on they are still big.  I put insoles in them at it helped some.",1,1
"Exactly what I was looking for. I'm not a hunter but I love wildlife. I also wanted something to keep an eye on our back door where deliveries are left. This fit the bill perfectly. This camera is amazing . I’m going to use as a Security home camera . I’m pretty impressive that 8 AA batteries can operate up to 6 months . It is nice compact size , spray water protection and extreme temperature is not Big deals for this camera . I also get nice pictures and videos from it !!!!! This game camera is awesome! My husband and I own a ranch in South Texas and it is a great way to keep track of the animals that come and eat. The picture is nice and clear and I love how it has the little screen inside to view pictures. Or simply get an SD card to save. Here are some pics from our back yard showing the quality. We wanted to test it out before putting it at the ranch. I'm so happy with this purchase! This has such a good photo and video quality and captures detected movement efficiently. See photos attached. It requires 8 AA batteries and an SD card though. Other than that it is very easy to use, the settings will let you choose if you’d like photos only, video only, or photos and videos combined. The photo and videos have timestamp and temperature. It’s a shame that I just bought this now in the middle of winter while animals are in hibernation! We live in the woods and have all sorts of animals in our backyard. This would be most useful in the summer time. The camera was bought as a gift for my husband, and he loves it!  That said, it was very easy to set up. The picture quality is great.  We have been testing it at our vacation condo, and the sound on the video along with the picture is really good.  Easy viewing, no need to download before hand.  Good value I needed a replacement hunting camera after my old one had broke, and this one hits the mark perfectly! It takes 8 double a batteries, and comes with a strap and mounting accessories. It also comes with a USB connector cord to cross data over onto your computer, however a micro SD card is needed as well. One thing I would like to note that it is very sturdy, I had set this up a few days ago and it withstood the wind, rain, and thunderstorms this weekend! I have bought a few that broke after being in harsh weather for a short period of time. The picture/video captures are of superior quality, a major upgrade from my old one. The night vision on this thing is out of this world! On my old one, you could just barely make out what was on the screen at night, however this one is HD quality, I love it! It automatically senses any type of movement as it has the high sensitivity motion sensors on it. I would like to point out that in comparison, this one picks up twice as much activity as my older one, which is fantastic. I keep this out on my land to watch deer activity, and this one does the job. I am extremely satisfied with this hunting camera! The Apeman H45 trailcam was a bit hard to get programmed at first.  Once I got all the programming down, I was happy with this camera.  I especially liked the large led screen and the compact size.  It seems very sturdy and the rear mount is convex in shape, when strapping the camera to the tree this allowed the camera to hold a secure position.  There are several settings for picture size/speed and will allow for video.  The night time photos are clear.  The time, date, and temperature stamp is a very nice option as well.  Being able to playback on the camera makes it easier than carrying a laptop out to read card.  I look forward to using it this year scouting our wildlife population. i bought this because someone was getting into my family's cars at night. It has since stopped, but i'm glad i bought this trail cam anyway. It's great. Took pictures of a raccoon and possum getting into my garage  at night. We no longer leave the door open for our cats! Will take pictures of school buss going by 300' away! Takes pictures of cats and birds walking by. Night time and day time pictures are great. This is our new security camera and i'm very pleased with it.",1,1
"First off I want to say Im using this for a PS4. Which it works great. Sound quality is good, love the volume control knob, but I do have a couple gripes. First the microphone is located on the left side only and isn't able to be moved. Secondly, the headset is one of the ones that lights up but it's powered through an extremely short USB plug. So on PS4, in order to use the lighted feature, you'd either need a USB extension or be sitting face to face with the system. It does function fine without the lights being used though, it just has an annoying dangling USB cord. These are good! I don't use headphones all the time when gaming, just when someone else is in the room. These are comfortable enough to wear for a few hours at a time. The sound quality is great! The mic works well.... my friends say I am louder when using my computer's default mic, softer when using the headphones (which some may prefer). There is a volume control right on the cord that i love. It's a long braided cord with a velcro strap to keep it shorter if you are close to where it plugs in. The lights are cool, and optional (uses a usb plug in addition to the aux plug for sound). Ear pads are large and soft, the huge pad on the top of the band is perfect. The whole thing is very large, so awkward and bulky on my head, but would fit a larger head well, i think. No complaints! This is my second headset I purchased, and I was once again disappointed. I'm a casual gamer, using this for gameplay and chat audio and found the sound would crackle at higher volumes. The most disappointing part, however is the microphone periodically produces loud feedback that essentially deafens my teammates. It can be remedied by pulling the cord out and replacing it, but who wants to have to do that? The feedback also seems to occur if the headset is plugged into the USB at the same time. It is possible I received a defective product, but after trying several headsets in this price range, I recommend spending a little more for something more reliable. I have struggled for over a month trying to find a headset for my PS4. The wired ones were too short, the wireless ones ate my WiFi to the point where all of my family members started having internet troubles, and Bluetooth headsets required the extra purchase of a Dongle. I finally stumbled upon this one, and I consider it my holy grail. It is insanely afforable (In my opinion, considering I had spent $75 or $100 per headset before this), AND it didn't require the separate dongle purchase since the dongle was already attached. I personally believe the sound quality is fine, however, I am not a sound quality critic. I am able to hear everything in my game at any volume and it sounds clear, which is enough for me. I haven't received any complaints from friends about my microphone quality either. Have only used it a couple of times with my PS4 VR setup and it was comfortable to use. Fairly light with well cushioned ear pieces. have not had occasion to use the mike but it folds up and out of the way and blends in with the blue black chrome design. Very nice looking almost futuristic. Has a long cord which I have not had to use  while connected to my VR headset. The mike design is really neat almost 1/2 wide and 6"" long and curved.. Really loving this headset. I originally bought it for my husband to use on PS4 after our son busted his old one, however, I seem to be the one getting the most use out of it on PC, lol. It's got great sound quality and I've had no issues with ""robot voices"" or anything. The only improvement I could suggest is making it lighter. After wearing this for a couple hours, I can definitely feel the strain on my neck. Other than that, this is awesome and the price is perfect for the quality. I bought them as a gift for my son.  He just received the head set and is super happy with the product. had these for over a month now and I still love them, they are definitely for people with big heads though so not at all useful for children or people with small heads. I highly doubt there is another pair of headsets on the market that give such a great audio experience for anywhere near this price. The metal in the headband means I wont have to worry about it breaking like other $80+ headsets ive bought before. I wish this company made a wireless version of these headsets though since my experience with wire shorts will probably be the downfall of this device, otherwise id expect these to last for years. But that shouldn't be a problem until ive gotten a lot more use out of this headset, and at this price if they only last 1 year then id happily pay for a replacement.",1,1

"I love these hats, they are cheap, cute, come in lots of colors, and are pretty much the right size for any baby's head since you can adjust the knot!  I gave it only 4 stars because the seam on one of the 4 hats I bought came apart during first washing, but otherwise they have held up fine.  We had several of these a couple years ago when my daughter was a baby and those were also great, no problems with them coming apart or anything.  Overall, and especially for the price, these hats are a great deal!! I am so in love with these hats, at first I thought they were a little pricey I found similar hats on eBay for way better prices but they do not match up to the quality of these hats. They have a very nice give to them I haven’t been able to use many other hats because they wouldn’t not fit over my sons head but these hats are very flexible and comfortable. I want these in every color Why are black hats so hard to find for newborns?!  Great value for the 3 pack, holds up in wash and is true to color.  Super cute when you don't tie the top.  Baby looks like a lil garden gnome :D As another reviewer wrote, if you roll the bottom up one, and tie the knot on the top it definitely fits a brand new baby and their tiny head. It also will fit larger to as they get older cause you can adjust the knot and unroll the bottom. They are soft and seriously super cute. I would purchase again! The seam is very rough. We use it inside out to avoid the rough seam. However, because of the shape of the cap, it won't stay on baby's head, it kept moving up. The material is very thick. We were buying the caps to keep our baby's ears straight. Didn't need a cap so warm. Hard to buy those things on the internet since you can't check the seam nor the material etc. The hats seemed nice quality but I received a completely different order than the ones I chose. I read that same thing happened to a few other buyers. The company needs to pay attention to the purchase details and ship correctly. Huge inconvenience. great little hats. Not too thick, can stretch, and soft enough that baby doesn't complain. This hat is way to big for a newborn. It fit my nephew who is 6m old but was huge on my newborns head. I would have kept it but I purchased a better quality one at a local store for $6 a hat and I couldn't keep this after comparing the quality.",1,1
"So far so good!  It arrived quickly and the packaging was just fine so the product was undamaged upon receipt as a result of the good packaging.  I installed a1 TB hard drive from my old laptop and plugged it into a USB port and it was up and running seconds later with no problems at all.  Since it's USB 3.0 speeds are pretty decent but you really need at minimum a 720 RPM hard drive or even better a Solid State Drive to really utilize the USB 3.0 speed. Good looking and unique case for laptop drive.  Has the practical advantage of allowing me to see what drive I've got installed without putting sticky labels on the outside.  Data transfer seems fast, but I have not attempted to benchmark as I've got too many other components between that will affect performance.  The drive electronics do allow me to boot from the drive (PC BIOS and USB port must also support as well), but it doesn't give low level access to the drive such as reading S.M.A.R.T. drive codes. These are really really cool external enclosures ... used them with Hybrid HD's/ SSD's / reg HD's - all with no issues decent transfer speeds - absolutely NO compatibility issues with using these on the Mac's or PC's we have in our home - worked great in using them for external storage - worked great when upgrade HD's ... great product over-all ... This worked perfectly and the low cost allowed me to recover my original investment in my (now too small) 120GB internal SSD as an external SSD (after upgrading to a 500GB internal SSB).  The instructions were good enough to make it easy to open, install, and close the case. Other than it not having a switch, I do like this small clear enclosure. Seems fast to me, certainly fast enough for my needs. Happy with the purchase. This is a really great enclosure! I put in my 256 SD drive and after formatting it on my mac as an ntfs, it worked like a charm, price is also awesome!!!!!! Love these I bought 5 for all the extra 2.5 hdd I had around that where just wasting away After upgrading my PS4 I was left with a 500 GB hard drive. So I thought of converting it to a external hard drive for my laptop, which lead me to look for a case for the hard drive. After plugging it in everything seem to be working as it should my only issue is that there are four pins still exposed in the case. Other than that I would recommend.",1,1

"As a trail camera this is a solid choice.  Picks up motion and takes a picture fairly quick.  My biggest complaints, the IR leds are CLEARLY visible to the human eye, DURING THE DAY!  I dont believe these are true 940nm. The image quality seems more like 8 or 10 mega pixels.  Its a bit pixelated and you cannot always read license plates at 10 feet or so. The chrome latches are very visible but seem much sturdier than plastic variations I have seen. EXCELLENT customer service and I couldn't be more happy with the camera!  This camera is great. I love the wide angle lens to cover the field. I love apeman's products. I have bought multiple things form them and they always deliver on the quality,especially for the price. I would definitely recommend this product After reading hundreds of reviews, I decided on this Apeman Game Camera. I liked the features, specs and the price. I have been wanting a game camera for some time, but a recent theft issue prompted me to get this now. When I received it, I was impressed. The build quality seemed nice and ease of settings was good, in spite of the poor instructions. I set it up on a tripod and started testing. I set it to ""video"", at 10 second durations. The sensors worked great and the camera captured good quality video, even in total darkness. Plus, the IR was not obvious, which I loved. I took multiple videos, from 5 seconds, to 30 seconds and everything worked as expected. Then however, it started taking only 5 second videos, regardless of the setting. I tried settings of every duration, from 10 seconds and longer, but for some reason, each video was only 5 seconds long. I reset the camera and tried everything to correct this, with no success. All videos were 5 seconds. This was not what I needed, so the Apeman was returned. I'm really disappointed that this issue started, because I like this game camera. We have a lot of wildlife at our fire station, that I love to watch and feed. I hoped to use this to capture them and their activities, but never got the chance. Based on reviews, I assume mine was an isolated issue, but an issue, none the less. I'm deciding on whether to try another identical Apeman or not. If I do, I'll post an update. I'm giving 2 stars, due to the build quality, and initial performance. Quite satisfied with the camera,  but the instruction book is quite confusing with its descriptive text (example: using ""test"" button when there is no ""test"" button- should say ""setup"" button to be consistent with the labels actually used on the camera.  Text is in a tiny booklet and poorly laid out. Quite typical of poor translations by foreign producers and the common attempt to produce a  ""one size fits most of product line""  mentality.  I wonder how many foreign made products are returned every year not due to poor quality, but because of unclear instructions resulting in improper set ups. This exactly the ""same"" camera that I returned because It was unsatisfactory, but marketed under a different name.  See my photo of the first camera.  I am giving it a 2-star rating because I feel this is disruptive marketing.  I will revisit my review in a couple of weeks after I have had a chance to actually use it. I was looking for a birthday present to my best friend and wanted to buy something special, that he doesn't have yet. He lives next to the woods so I thought it would be cool for him to experience some wildlife! He was quite excited about the present right away so we mounted it to one of the pine trees and left there for a couple days. He told me he was able to catch deers, rabbits, and even a gorgeous fox on this camera! I will share those videos here once I get those.",1,1
"I'm 5""5 and about 163lbs C 36 cup . ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Very good material, well packaged and beautiful color. Definitely a great buy! I ordered this swimsuit in a 2x and 3x, usually I wear a L - for reference I am 5'7"", 165 pounds, hourglass body type and wear a 36C. The 2x bottom fit while the top cups were a little too small; the 3x bottom didn't hold me as well as but the top fit perfectly. Both sizes elastic at top dug in a little bit. I loved the molded, underwire structure of the top and that the straps are adjustable. The bottoms have a excellent amount of ruching to camouflage any roll/muffin top/ pouch, and was sewn down so I wouldn't have to worry about it sliding around. Overall, the swimsuit is super cute and colors are amazing. It fit surprisingly well, considering a couple of the reviews. I totally love it, except the top was completely incorrectly sewn and looks ridiculous, I'm going to have to return it! So gorgeous!!! I am a 12/14 and got the 4xl. It's perfect for my curvy body. Definitely buying more colors. Love this!!! I received lots of compliments. Such a cute swimsuit! Fit perfectly. Gives the boobs alot of support. Overall extremely happy with this! Love it! Im 5 5 and 180 pounds, size 12. The whole thing looks ridiculously cute. Im quite top heavy (36E) so I didn't expect the top to be very supportive but it does an okay job. I might alter it a bit to make it tighter. On the whole a great buy! I'm 5'6, 155lbs and a size 8. I got the XL (8/10) and it fits me PERFECTLY! It came in nice packaging with a sanitation sticker in the bottom. I feel like it's average quality; same quality that I would expect to pay for a suit from Target. I love how the suit fits--I wanted a bikini, but also something that I could feel confident in while covering my Momma belly...this is it! I will say the only thing that I didn't like about it is that the top doesn't come undone; so, you have to stretch it to get it over your head. I like that the straps are removable...you can keep em on, criss-cross the back, or take them completely off. I seriously love this suit! I'm going to order a few more in different colors!",1,1
"This is screen printed on a Fruit of the Loom HD shirt. It looks nice and washed up well. True to size and looks just like the picture. I washed it on cold, reshaped it, and air-dried it by laying it on a drying rack. Turned out great. Dilly dilly! The perfect shirt for my husband. He receives a lot of positive comments when he wears this out. I didn’t want any indication of it being a beer shirt besides the obvious quote and it didn’t. My son wants one as well which thrilled my husband that his son approves of something he’d wear. Lol While it's a fine shirt, the fit was a little too large in comparison to other extra-large t-shirts i have bought. But - that's still better than too small. So 4 stars instead of 5. I was very pleased with the T-shirt. I wrote that it fits as expected, however it is a tad larger than I had expected but just on the larger side of a medium. Good quality and the silk screen print was done superbly. I would recommend. my husband loved it, after seeing the commercials I just had to get it for him. It's a nice heave t-shirt without flaws. Got it for my Son as a gift, he Loves it!!! I bought this for my son, he loves it.",1,1
"Drive is dead completely after 1 month light use. I was transferring medical information between devices. No physical damage, just started clicking after a file transfer. I could not even back up my files, the drive is completely inaccessible. Seagate Data Recovery Services wanted 600 dollars to recover the data from the 1 month old, warranty covered hard drive. Worked for 3 days. A complete nightmare. Lost almost 15,000 photos I transferred to the drive last night. My son was coming over today setup a cloud backup account for me, and then I wake up to find the drive is dead. Absolutely devastated. Now the drive just beeps and makes various whirling noises and wont be recognized by any computer. Seems like this is a common story in the reviews. Buy at your own risk, and whatever you do, never have valuable documents only on this drive for any moment of time. Being a brand new hard-drive, I thought I could move files to it and then back up to the cloud the next day, and that mistake has cost me dearly. Hi, I am writing a feedback with hope that someone will see this article and will not buy this device. We bought 2 disks Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Slim 2TB Portable External Hard Drive, Platinum (STEH2000100) hoping that it will store information without problems, but after 4 months this device began to make noises and became invisible to the system. The hard drive suddenly stopped working after 22 days out of the box, and only 4 uses of image file transfers. The drive makes about a dozen very faint beeps when connected, and that's about it. No computer will recognize it. This product was clearly made to look pretty. Functionality was placed on the back burner. The hard drive was not abused in any way. If you buy this drive, spend the extra $10 for data recovery in the warranty. I bought this drive a little over 6 months ago and it has already failed. It is covered under warranty, but not my data. I always take meticulous care of hard drives and I have heard this has happened to a lot of people who have this product. I also always store my data in 2 places, but switched all my files over for one day to run a program I needed for school that required more room on my SSD laptop. It was in that 7 hours that this drive decided to start beeping and becoming unrecognizable. Seagate is now saying it will cost me upwards of $500 for their failed product and data recovery services elsewhere are wary because of this drive's slim size.",-1,-1

"This is a high quality hard shell case that works great for smaller items that you would normally throw in your bag.  For my application, I am using it as storage solution for electronic charging cables and a portable battery charger for my bug out bag. Everything fits nicely inside the case and a nice surprise is that the inside is felt lined. I did notice that the logo on the outside was slightly coming off however this was not a big deal and I unstiched it. Everything else looks great on the case after close inspection. Worth the price for a great organizer. For what I need it for it is a great case. I first bought an Amazon Basics zip case. It is a great case as well but I outgrew it This thing is great, I packed this out with multiple chargers an old digital camera, a go pro, multiple phone chargers and battery packs, a pen, a few pieces of paper, and even some small accessories ... I’m confident that everything is super protected and the zipper seems solid.  I’m taking it all on a trip to Bali next week! I like this case. Both sides are like deep in the case. On one side, it is holding cords, mini-power strip, and chargers. On the other side, it is holding my new WD My Passport Wireless Pro along with the Surface Arc mouse. In the middle are pockets that hold various things. Although it is heavy, I am happy that my accessories are at my reach. I bought this to carry a mini projector. The inside compartments are great with plenty of storage. Not sure where I went wrong but the projector is almost too big for the case, but it does fit and is tight. Definitely not the fault of the case. That one is on me. All-in-all, it is a nice case. However, the zippers around the corners are VERY tight but they do zip. I saw the same thing from another buyer post before I bought it as well. Plenty of room for media cards, cords and such. Nice carrying bag for electronics. Its got a few different compartments and holds an lot of stuff. I like it for traveling. Just the right size for a carry on bag. Well made, except it would was not big enough to store the mount for my GPS.  I returned it for a full refund from Amazon. Just what I wanted for my external audio interface!!",1,1
"Charcoal Black is not even close to the image. It is more of a light grey. The fabric and cut are fine, but the color is so misleading that I will be sending it back. This is a super soft shirt and fit as expected initially.  It's very thin, the material, just close to see-through.  Comfortable.  Be very leery of the dryer... this cotton t shirt shrinks like crazy in it!  Unfortunately, I dried in the dryer the aqua coloured one which was my favourite.  I can no longer wear it - it's skin tight.  I ordered a Medium and it shrunk a full size.  I also ordered Red Triblend and Charcoal and now hang both to dry and are fine.  Not a bad price for this product.  I might recommend ordering a size up and then shrinking it if you are stuck on using a dryer all the time but I have not re-ordered in a larger size to try this. Bought six to wear on a remote job site; wore only them every day for four months. Since I've been back I've been dissatisfied with other shirts. Wicked comfortable and have maintained their as-new quality. Ive had this shirt for almost TWO YEARS now and it's time to write a review! The fabric is soft and pliable, it doesn't shrink in the wash, it's not too thin but it's thinner than the standard 100% cotton tee, so much more comfortable than 100% cotton tee as well. I ordered 5 shirts all together. Their quality seems solid. They feel slightly thin light material (summer or spring shirt unlike an normal graphic t shirt from a big box store) but well made.  I ordered red, clay, teal,royal blue, and black.  First off fast shipping. Way before expected delivery. Overall satisfied with purchase. As far as fit goes. If you're a big guy go a size up. If you're a muscular guy  it depends on the fit you want. Actual size will fit loose around the stomach tight on the chest and arms. I ordered 4 large and 1 medium since unsure of fit. I'm coming in right at about 6 foot  210 pounds. The medium was a little small for my liking. Arms too short and tight and also felt tight across the chest(clay). Large felt less snug but very form fitting still. So if you're looking for that shirt that's going to look well on your body go for the large. On the other hand the red I ordered just didn't seem to look as well as the others. Overall great price and great purchase. Fit was good.  Very comfortable, color much bolder than pictured, but will probably fade with washing.  I like the faded look, so fading with time is OK with me.  Appears well made. I mostly wear v-neck tee shirts in the summer.  Never could stand the regular neck hugging tee shirts in the warm weather.  This one fits my slim body build perfectly.  I wear between a medium and large and the large size is just right.  The material is soft and light, perfect for summer.  Love the colors.  Seems like all the v-necks for men sold in local big box stores are the same old boring white, grey, and black. The fit around the chest and sleeves are great for a guy who wears ""Small"" on average, but the length around the waist is way too long. Well not way too long like a skirt, but just long enough to where it bunches up too much and no longer looks fitted.",1,1
Friendly & responsive seller. Cheap & nice tattoos. Yet to use...   Awesome same as shown on pic,1,1
"Got it for playing Destiny on PS4 and its amazing. I wear it for hours on end non-stop and it never gets uncomfortable. Because it is a 2-ear headphone setup, you'll want to lower your in-game music volume so that you can hear the chat over it, the speakers can get very loud if you want them to. They also tend to cancel out outside noise really well. I love that the microphone is long and reaches all the way around so you can position the flexible stem comfortably directly in front of your mouth without it being too close. The thing to be aware of is that the switch to turn on the mic is on the end of the mouthpiece, so if you put the foam cover over it, it makes it a little challenging to access the switch. Otherwise I can not think of a thing that could be improved and I'm so glad I only spent 1/4 of what it costs to get the Sony ps4 brand! My brother has the PS4 ones and I can say from comparing them that these are only slightly less comfortable and just as good functionally so there's no reason not to save the money and get these. My teen says it's a really good headset with better sound quality than his last that cost twice as much.  They're def noise cancelling bc he can't hear me when I'm screaming his name from his doorway anymore lol. Would give it five stars but have never tried $100.00 plus headphones so cant give a comparison.  But for the price I got these at I am blown away by the over ear comfort and not having to adjust by pulling on either side to get the head band to feel right.  The small volume control on the left ear speaker is small but adjustment with my PC and the headphones is easy and I get the right level of volume I like.  the Mic is great also flexible and easy to adjust, not like the stiff plastic ones on most headphones.  They look and appear to be very well made.  All in all a really nice product, but time will tell. Great headsets. They make it easy to tell where enemies are. Much better than the xbox stereo headsets. Audio can be just a slight bit tinny but then I'm a bit of an audiophile. Volume control on bottom of left earpiece makes adjusting computer volume easy. Very comfortable and somewhat breathable. Does not block out room sounds very well but with a small kid that is actually a plus for me.  Comes with mic puff and pc splitter. Great value! I would easily buy again. I bought one of these, then, my son liked it so much that I bought one more for my other son. Actually, the boys did all the research and chose it themselves. These look super cool  and sturdy. We will see how long they last, but for now they're pretty awesome. The package arrived on time, which was good because they both kept checking the mail, and it came in a nice box. It was a great deal for the $ and so far, they love them! What a nice surprise while using this NUBWO N2 Gaming Headest and hearing such great sound from them!! They are very comfortable to wear and don't bother me at anytime while listening to music or playing Xbox games. The over the ear design fits very well and the ear padding is perfect (for me). For an inexpensive pair of headphones that work as well as more expensive headphones I give these 5 stars. Thank you!! I haven't seen an issue with this item yet. I had just lost use of a previous mic which i was hesitant on as well, but this one really out does it by a few things. With the volume monitor, the mute mechanism and the strength of the way the earphones sit on my head/ears. I also highly am excited about the braided cord since those cords are often ones that last longer. (My last mic didn't have one and started to break because of it). Quality and sound is great so far. Im hoping they don't stop after a month or something. Will update soon. First off, I’m EXTREMELY SURPRISED that the headset hasn’t failed on me yet. Mainly due to how cheap it is. Second, I’m no gaming headset guru, so when it comes to the sound of the headset, TO ME, this it’s perfectly fine. I hear everything from the game I play crystal clear. Third the headset does feel a bit bulky, but I got used to it over time. I’ve had this headset for a bit over 2 months I believe, and it hasn’t had any sort of technical issues at all! Mind you, I’m someone who just leaves the headset lying around at times as well. So if you’re in need of a headset and are tight on cash; or if you just want to save some $$$, then this headset won’t disappoint.",1,1

"I bought this for my Nintendo Switch and it's great.  I formatted it using Nintendo's recommended formatting tool and I haven't had any issues w/ it. This card tested at 88MB/s read, so it meets its claim. The 4K speeds are fairly slow at 5MB/s and the sequential write is 15.8 MB/s which should suffice for most applications. This will work well for most people's needs. I've been using this SanDisk Ultra 64Gb Card in my Verizon 8"" Ellipsis tablet for about 6 months and it has been extremely reliable for storing and allowing playback of a large amount of movies I've converted from DVD to MP4s for the kids to watch.  Since the card comes with an SD Card adaptor, I can easily copy the videos using my Mac's SD slot and then insert the microSD card into the slot of the tablet.  At 64GB, I have plenty of room for 50 or more videos.  I haven't noticed any lag or buffering issues when playing the movies back using the VLC Video application on the tablet. My GoPro said ""SD ERROR"" and kept shutting down, so took the card out of my GoPro, and put it into SanDisk's adapter, and inserted it into my laptop to try to format it. I've had the 200GB card for about 7 months now.  It has been in regular use, inside of a Samsung S7 Edge phone.  According to my phone, after formatting it, I have 183GB usable of the 200GB card.  I don't have a single gripe about this card.  It holds more than enough data for me and processes fast enough to take the extreme high definition photos and videos.  I have yet to have an issue of any sort with it.  My photo and video libraries load up very quickly and without a hitch.  Sure, you could try to get all fancy and measure the actual transfer rates, but if it works, I'm not concerned about specific numbers.  So purchase this card.  You won't have to worry about losing any of your ""questionable"" bedroom content, or any of your cat videos due to a bad card. Bought for my Nintendo Switch. So far, so good. You'll need to update your Switch online in order to use and acknowledge this product. SanDisk has always made great product. This micro-SD is no different, and I have in excess of 3,000 songs on the chip in my phone. Only bummer is I stepped on my phone (but that's another sorry story). In days not too many years past in the receding fog of memory, if you wanted to carry 3,000 songs around, you'd need a truss, afterwards, a trailer or, well, you get my drift. Nowadays, if your grasp on reality is truly tenuous, at best, you can buy mp3 players that'll hold some 2TB worth of music. Criminy, does the library of Congress even sport those kind of numbers? That's an enormous amount of tuneage, and one that reflects a seriously advanced case of Audio OCD (IMO). You need that much music, you should own a record-company, a radio station, or both. But SanDisk to the rescue! And for the price of a song (no pun intended) you can stuff a lifetime of collected tunes onto this piece of Silicon-Valley wonderfulness. Initially it worked great; recognized immediately by my Droid Maxx 2, fast transfer times, etc. However, as of last night (just short of a month of use), it started doing the infamous 'random unmount' bug. I was playing music and it started to fail reading files, then after a few minutes and a few reboots/rescans it got to the point where it consistently unmounted within 30 seconds of a restart and I haven't gotten it to work since. Apparently SanDisk and PNY SD cards are both notorious for this issue in Android devices, as per researching the issue on the Android forums.",1,1
"Very well made, top quality product - recommended - I have purchased several UGREEN products, and have found them to be reliably very good quality - a brand I now look out for on Amazon Awesome bag, got it specifically to put extra external hard drives into. Bigger than I expected, great quality. High quality case and holds most of my gears cables. The package arrived two days after placing the order. The organizer is exactly what I needed. I have a slim backpack and the organizer holds all my cables and other gadgets. It is slim, so it does not take up a lot of volume. Really liked this for our Disney trips. Kept things organized and secure in my backpack. Keeps you organized on the go. Great size to keep in carry-on bag or check in when flying. I love this organaizer. It’s super cool. Absolutely wonderful product - arrived quickly. Suits my needs (I'm even able to fit my Kindle Fire 7 (in its own case) in this organizer. Certainly makes travel easier. The product arrived complete with a protective UGREEN bag. Would recommend highly for anyone looking for a nice, sturdy electronics case for travel.",1,1
"fits well. i like the gildan brand shirts. i really dont usually wear white at all. and i tried seeing if i could rock the crew neck (i always wear V) so these had to go back. we ended up buying a whole bunch of the black versions that are V-neck After the first wash, all the length shrunk out. I tried one on out of the package, but then washed them all.  I would guess that about 4 inches of length was lost.  The shirts tuck in fine when getting dressed, but after sitting down there really is no pint to have the undershirt tucked in. Arrived on time, six awesome shirts, 100% Cotton, fabric feels great against the skin,  I would definitely buy again from this seller!!!! Fit well and are soft. I expect that they will wear as well as the last one;s that I bought. comparing quality and price, it is a fair. Very happy with purchase thank you. Great shirts, great price, and these shirts fit just like I want them to. Quality shirts at a low price.  Last just as long as the name brands",1,1
Excellent fit. Price was great . THIS IS A NICE SUIT,1,1
"I bought this because I was lazy and didn't feel like driving to Whole Foods and buying their $300 dishwashing, eco friendly, grass free, free range, no anti-biotics, no hormones, vegan, gluten free soap that my wife likes. Point is, this works great. I'm not a fan of washing dishes in the sink BEFORE putting them in the washer... why would I bother doing that? That's wasteful. To prove my point, I left a small amount of smeared egg residue on some plates and then some salad remnants and salad dressing on a glass bowl. Filled up the machine completely and when it was done, the glass bowl looked brand new and the plates looked unused and have a reflection now so I can see what a whipped and defeated being I've become. Read it somewhere that you can use 1/2 a tablet and works perfectly fine... I was skeptical but tried it .. and it works even better, because I have no soapy residue.  Been doing it for years. Seriously, I NEVER leave reviews for products unless they're exceptionally outstanding! I had FINALLY run out of my Finish Powerball packets the day these arrived & actually had to use them to clean the remnants of what was left on the dishes their first time through. As much as I thought I was enjoying the Finish brand all this time, they simply don't even compare to these! AND, as other users suggested, I only had to use 1/2 the tablet & our dishes have NEVER been this clean & sparkly! I bought the smaller box just to try them first, but will be buying the larger box to get a YEARS worth of dishwasher tablets for like $32 soon. So beyond worth it! Thanks for such a great natural & biofriendly product Ecover! I had been searching for a product that works after the required reformulation of dishwasher detergents a few years ago.  I found that Cascade Platinum worked great but was extremely fragranced, to the point that the storage cupboard smelled, even with the package sealed shut.  When using the Cascade, the dishwasher and dishes themselves also smelled and you could taste the detergent when drinking from glasses.  I could not stand having the Cascade in the house. I Ordered these because I was starting to feel uncomfortable with the amount of soap scent That was left behind on my dishes from traditional popular brand dishwasher packs. My kids sippy cups would smell strongly of soap even with additional rinsing and I hated them drinking from that. I decided to try these as they are more natural. So far they are working great. We've run several loads. Dishes have all come clean and there's no scent left behind. I'm happy to pay a bit more for these tablets. These work great - so much better than the cascade complete we were using. That product left a horrible soap fragrance on every item and had to be re-run every time without soap to remove smell - huge waste of water an god know how many unnecessary chemicals in that detergent! I don't want my water, coffee, cereal etc... to taste like soap or fragrance - what is wrong with these companies that think thisis what consumers want in their ""clean"" FOOD containers!",1,1
"Buyer beware these boots are at least 2 shades darker than they appear on amazons pic. They run large I wanted to return them because I wasn't happy with the color and they did not fit me, they run large. This company will not pay return shipping even if the product color was not represent correctly and the customer is unhappy. Shipping going to cost about a third of the of the original cost of the boots to return them, again buyer beware! I can't speak to durability in the long term, but I will say that they feel great on my feet and look sharp. They're not flashy -- you're not going to stand out in a crowd -- and the soles aren't leather, so they won't exactly work with your favorite suit. But with a pair of jeans, these boots look great. They're more comfortable than my old boots, which had leather soles and were made of watersnake skin, and while they aren't as distinctive-looking, they're still very nice. My boots came in, and my excitement was immediately ruined upon opening the box. The left shoe had scuff marks on the toe, and the stitching running down the side looked like it was about to pop. I am aware leather boots will accrue scuffs, but I want to be personally responsible for each scuff. The stitching is what really bothers me. Either the boots were horribly made, severely mis-handled, or somebody else had worn them for a while before they were shipped to me. I ordered a replacement pair, so I'll re-visit this review in a couple days when they get here. I would have been nice to get a decent looking pair on the first go around, however. My boots came all scarred and marked up! Boots received were a dark chocolate color...not tan as shown in picture. Both the boot and shaft are the same dark color. I am waiting on Sheplers to reply to my inquiry.  I will update.  Andy, Raleigh. Given the good price, and the surprisingly good fit, I'm quite pleased with my purchase of this footwear and would buy it again. True, it's not an all-leather boot. The uppers are synthetic, but they feel good and look durable. I'm not crazy about the design of the stitching, which is a little too ""yee-haw"" for my taste, but that's me. So far, after weeks of hard wear, these Made-in-China cowboy kicks have performed as promised. The boots fit great, and are well made. My only disappointment was that the shaft is not leather. Very good for the price though. I bought them for everyday wear, and have not had any problems. I already own a pair of boots like this in black color and size men's regular a year ago.  My one year old boots had only been worn 3 times because I only wear it on a special function.  The rubber sole to me takes a slight getting used to when one is used to walking with leather sole.  The sole of the boots stick to the floor unlike my leather shoes and boots with leather bottom.  My black regular size boots are still tight inside after 3 wearing each worn more then 4 hours each. My new antique tan boots I ordered extra wide because it's the only wide available size after regular. Now my size 8 feet feels loose inside my new antique tan boots.  The leather shoe portion of the boots has a nice finish like my black boots. The shaft has nice design stitching but because it's manmade (probably vinyl) tends to be soft and therefore, gives the impression the boot shaft a flimsy feeling like its going to fold lower and not stay upright when it's start to get old. My new antique tan boots coming in 2x wide appear to be looser and may require me to buy much thicker and longer socks than my current military socks.  I hope it will not be the case.  Maybe the third time will be a charm for a pair of Larefo boots?.",1,1

"What can I say? T-Fal speaks for itself. Great quality & very durable. Wife lovers them!  What else matters? The set is working as advertised. Excellent set for the money. Very pleased with the set. Cooks and cleans well. Great investment I love my new T-fal pans.  They were an excellent value.  I would recommend them to everyone. Love these pans, heavy duty, easy clean, work perfect on my new glass top stove! Couldn't be happier I ordered these as a gift for my daughter in North Carolina. She said this is the worst set of pots and pans that she has ever owned! Everytime she uses them and washes them, the coating on the inside and the outside is coming off!! Said her old Wal-Mart pans were better!! I wish I would have never ordered them for her, she is very unhappy with the whole set! Her Wal-Mart set was 14 Year’s old and better than this new set🙁🙁 Love them.",1,1
"These original Muck Scrub Boots are very comfortable! I ordered (according to the size chart) a men's size 7/women's 8, because I have had toe surgery on both big toes and needed more room than the size 7 I used to wear. Since they are a size larger, they feel roomy but I can wear any type of sock and not feel they are too tight. I have a high arch and even though I can feel an arch in the boots it is not enough to call support. However, I can wear them all day without a problem. The height of the boot is perfect for me because I am short and have found most generic mud boots are too high on my leg to be comfortable. I also have large calves and these boot are not tight at all. I can still tuck my jeans inside the boot. I wore them in the mud and rain and my feet stayed warm and dry. Overall, no complaints, I am happy with these Muck boots. 3 months in and working great as poultry boots - including waterfowl. With heavy socks, my feet stay warm even in winter. Fit as expected and appear to be well made ... Only time will tell on how well, but I expect them to last a long while. I was very skeptical at first about wearing a boot to do yardwork and was very concerned about comfort. However, I really needed something that was going to withstand all the dirt stains and physical demands from tools ground and gravel  to prevent from destroying my other shoes. Beware... I have two pairs of Muck boots.  One slipper size and the scrub boots.  I wear the slipper ones nearly day and the Scrub boots once every two weeks or so.  The Scrub boots have developed cracks through the material where it flexes on the front of the foot, midway up.  They are useless and cannot be used.  Get another brand I have downgraded these from 5 starts because one of the boot's top stitching now cuts into my skin if I do not put something between the boot and my bare skin. I used these for almost an entire year without issues so I'm not sure what happened. Although I have machine washed them, the stitching is intact and it is only occurring on one boot so I'm not sure that is the problem. I'll keep wearing them but now have to be careful because it actually cuts very deeply. I hope these wear out soon so I can replace them but I don't think that will happen anytime soon. :( These are well made and probably good boots.  BUT the toe area is tooo small.  I bought these as successors to my well-fitting and much loved low Muck boots whose soft non-slip sole has worn dangerously smooth.  So, I ordered the same size in a slightly  higher boot. No joy.  I wear these offshore fishing from San Diego and after one day my feet hurt.  So I shelved them and returned to my (back-up) worn low Muck boots.  I will be returning these. I am a Muck Boot fan, but the toe spaces are apparently not consistent among styles. This is my second pair of Mucks and I love them.  Last and last.  Bought a second pair for my hubby as well.  We wear these frequently as we have about 5 acres to take care of.  You can jump in and out of them easily and quickly.  We are sold on Mucks boots!! Working around the yard 8 or 9 months of the year, they are just what is needed.  i wear lighter ""Dickies"" work sox with my Scrubs; take a normal size 10.5 mens but these are size 10 and they fit great.  This is the 4th pair of Muck's I've owned and my family have..God knows how many pair are in my mudroom right now...and all seasons.  Great product and worth the $$.",1,1
"Generally liked it, with some small quibbles. Looking for a better quality belt. It's also too small for my son. Ordered for my 11 y/o son and so far holding up very well.  Have a lot of difficulty finding a belt that will hold up for very long, even when they say they are durable leather they seem to fall apart.  This one seems very durable and looks like it will hold up for a while. Great belt & made well too. It's shorter in length than I thought it would be, but what the heck? it still fits (narrowly). Fits my thin 3yr with no problem. Even fits my 2yr, he has to use the first or last hole depending on how you look at it. Fits my 8 year old comfortably. Was looking for a good quality belt. And this one is awesome It is a nice belt but it is not 100% leather. It is imitation leather and it says so on the belt. Deceptive advertising. This is a very difficult product to find in stores.  As one expects, it is of excellent design and quality.  And the price at which it was purchased, made it an extraordinary value.",1,1

"I cannot count how many charging cables I have purchased for my iPhone's. I never know if they are going to just stop working and I have grown to believe they are all disposable without warning. I have run out of power in airports, meetings, my car  only to find my cable will not charge my iPhone. It is so aggravating. I am pleased with this product. It is an Apple certified product and meets all the specifications and standards that Apple requires for their products. Sticking with products that are certified by those guidelines will insure the quality of the products and in return lengthen the life of your phone or tablet battery as well. I bought four of these to help keep all of our devices charges up. Working great I've ordered endless cables and they all work great for a week and then die. I decided to try this one since it had the lifetime warranty and I'm so glad I did. It's excellent and pretty much just like the Apple USB. It charges my phone in the car super fast and even faster via wall charger. I would highly recommend. After going through wire after wire that would last anywhere from 1-4 months and costing $6-$12, it was time for me to invest in a good quality wire that was going to last me. I found Syncwire that seemed to be of good quality, a great price, AND had a lifetime warranty. I was sold. After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy because they mentioned that their cables didn't work. However, my product that came in works perfectly fine so I would take a chance and get this. It's hard to find good Apple chargers that aren't sold from Apple, so I would go with this one if you are looking to buy a charger cable. I was surprised by the quality of the product..its the first wire other than apple own products am quite confident to use with my 6s..i bought the rose gold to match my wife 6s..the color matches exactly iphone's rose gold color..its an amazing product  Works Great Just as good as any Apple lightning Cable!! I have been using this cable for over a month now And it works just great! I use an apple cube wall connector for power and no issues. It is fast and reliable. No error messages or not supported messages. I use it every night overnight before i go to bed and also sometimes on long work days to plug into my portable 20,000 mah  battery.  This was a good buy!",1,1
"Really nice shoe, unfortunately it was too loose a fit, and I had to return them.  Painless Amazon return BTW.  I ordered a size 11.5D, because that is my shoe size.  I could easily fit my index index finger between my heel and the shoe (with a sock on).  Might re-order a pair in size 10.5 or 11 to get a snug fit when sockless. UPDATE:  I originally ordered these shoes using the Seller's sizing guide, but the procedure indicated I should be ordering a 9.5 although I normally wear a size 10.  Okay, so I thought its better to be on the safe side to follow the manufacturer's recommended size, being this was a slip-on shoe.  Unfortunately, it was indeed smaller that I was comfortable with and I had to admit, I was harsh with my rating. I wanted to like these, a much needed foot covering for my life style. BUTTT these will cause and create bunions in no time. they are way too tight around the toes and smash them together. So many, Too many men & women substitute style for healthy feet when it comes to shoes. NO, they shouldn't be super tight unless you are in a specialty sport like wrestling or ballet, even then, its sad but true/reality, YOU ARE RUINING YOUR FEET. These are cool looking, and fit perfectly length wise, but the front of the shoe smashes my toes together and is made improperly. Those who have had their feet ""trained"" for years and already have nasty bunions, these should fit ok, but your only continuing to ruin your feet=your choice=ok. I loved them in the beginning, they were just slightly large but didn't fall off my feet, so I kept them, since they didn't come in half sizes.  I downgraded them from a 5 star to a 4 star because they work exceptionally well for my trips out on my boat, I can take them off right away if they get wet, they dry quickly and can be put back on in 1-15 minutes, Nice!  The problem is, if you wear them all day long and you can't take them off to dry out and they get wet at different times throughout the day, by the end of the day, they stink and they stink bad.  I've washed them twice and can't get the stink out of them.  I will buy another pair but I'll be much more careful of how and when I wear them, going forward..  Super comfy too. I had to return due to the fact that they ran large by a 1/2 size. Just a great pair of water shoes that are nice enough to casually wear anywhere. Even though they are water shoes and work great in the water, I almost didn't want to get them wet because they were so comfortable to wear anytime of day. Bought these for a Hawaiian vacation.  Wanted something to protect feet from the abundant lava rock beaches.  They worked well for that and are as advertised.  Only issue I found was they are just a slight bit too snug at the very top of the shoe where it meets the top of your foot; after a few hours of wearing, you start to feel them dig in.  If they had a slight bit of give or stretch, they would have been excellent.  Other than that, the size fit well and they look good too. These fit well and dry quickly. The only downfall I ran into was that they are a little rough on the back of the ankles and left my with bad blisters from them rubbing.",1,1
"I was hesitant to buy swim shoes because of the image I had in my head of them but I was so pleasantly surprised when these arrived! Not only are they comfortable and light weight but they're pretty cute if I so say so myself! The best water walking shoes this side of the Mississippi. Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration, but they did out perform the water shoes of the rest of the group on my last adventure. The best feature is the lack of an insole. The first time my husband rinsed his shoe out, his insole dislodged and tried to float away.  Since mine were each one solid shoe, they could be rinsed easily. Plus, the insole couldn't bunch up uncomfortably. The second benefit was the quality craftsmanship. My friend walked about ten feet before her shoe had a rip in the mesh. It was the first time she'd worn the pair. I have used mine countless times and after rinsing them off with a hose and leaving them in the sun to dry, they look like new again. Finally, they work better than galoshes since there is no limit for how deep I can go. The few people who tried to wear calf high boots were limited on where they could travel and were left to struggle through brambles to keep up. My shoes were also the fastest to dry and pick up very little sand and gravel. They are a delight to use. Each person in the group struggled, but me. These water walking shoes are the best around. I bought these in a size 8.5 for myself and size 6 for my daughter. We wore them everyday on the Big Island, Hawaii. We traversed lava tubes & lava fields and waterfalls, explored beaches, snorkeled and walked miles on sidewalks in towns and had not one single problem with these shoes. They dried sitting out in our condo & were completely ready the next morning, even though my husband's & son's Body Glove shoes were not.  After 10 days of vacationing, they still look brand new.  I washed and dried them in our washer & dryer - and they came out perfectly. These are the best and most comfortable water shoes for hydrofit water exercises that I've found.  They fit snug but not enough to go size up.  It's true to size and they will stay on your feet as the material stretches.  I was in the deep end of pool and these did not feel they were moving around on my feet like other water shoes I've worn in the past (namely Speedo).  This also has a fairly good grip so you are not slipping all over the bottom of the pool like the other brand (Speedo).  Overall I give these a high rating for quality and doing what a water exercise should do... help you perform better and not be a hinderance to your mobility. These are better than expected - they fit nicely, I wear a 7.5 and they were just right - a tiny bit snug but that is exactly what I needed. I tried these out walking through the Pecos river with fast flowing water and slippery uneven rocks. Then I walked through a maze of caves with waterfalls running through them, rushing water and climbing on wet slippery boulders and rocks. The soles have fantastic grip and for not being very sure-footed, I felt very confident in them. Plus they are really cute and I would have no problem wearing them when I'm out an about. Bought four of these for my family for our river hike. They are comfortable and the bottoms are thick enough that they protect your feet. Sand does get in but not as much as other sandals or shoes. Very comfortable, lightweight and quick drying. The mesh is a tighter weave than other water shoes I have had, not too much sand gets inside. I would highly recommend these shoes! Working well for my Aqua Zumba class my feet are no longer taking a beating on the cement floor",1,1

"I got it to use as a nanny camera but have found myself using it for a bunch of other things. This's tiny camera and picture quality is very excellent,support HD 1080p, but actually records HD video.it unscrews to give you access to a USB to plug into your computer.  If you need to spy on someone in a meeting, this would do the trick for sure!  So cool is. The big difference compared with the tiny camera I bought earlier is that the device is not easy to heat,especially when charging, the heat is very small.But the video was pretty clear.I was surprised. Easy, easy and easy. Easy to carry, easy to use and easy to record whenever I want. Sometimes, I put it on the living room when all family leave. Sometimes, I put it on the car instead of car dash. High recommended. This is a well made camera, high HD resolution, smooth video recording, compact size and light weight for convenience to carry out. This camera is hard to be noticed if you use it as a hidden camera. This is a much better camera than the other one I purchased earlier. This product is very easy to operate . The front and rear clips help to attach to pocket easily and make hand-free recording. The size of the camera is tiny and it's well hidden. I love this tiny gadget! It is so small that I can hide anywhere & the battery last hours. Every charge can give it a long run. The quality is really nice with the price! I love this useful little equipment. Very small camera with HD resolution image. Easy to use and set up, I use it to shoot footage of my dogs for youtube. They hates my big camera but this one they dont even know its a camera.",1,1

"I am a paramedic and use this boot for work. I was skeptical at first due to the low price. Boots usually last me around 6-8 months, I am very hard on them. I will update this as I use them more but I will list my first impressions below. These are the second pair I have bought. I was able to get 2 years out of the first pair before I wore a small hole in the sole. I work as a Security Officer so I do a lot of walking on all kinds of terrain from concrete, sand, landscaping rock and pea gravel to dirt and I have had no issues with foot slippage. These boots have an aggressive sole pattern so occasionally I might get a piece of gravel stuck in the tread. When you first get them they are kind of stiff but after the first week they tend to break in a bit. I found that for me not using the top two eyelets when lacing the boots makes it a little easier to flex your ankles when walking. All in all I really like these boots especially the zipper on the side which means I only need to lace my boots the first time I put them on, after that I just unzip them to take them off and Zip them to put them on. I would definitely recommend these boots to any Security Officer or person that needs to have stable footing. I was very surprised when I got these boots.  I wear an 11w in dress shoes, 11.5 in tennis shoes, and 12w in Ariat boots.  So, I ordered 11w in these boots and then was worried when I read the reviews and people were saying to get a size up.  However, to my surprise the boots fit perfect.  They seem very comfortable, I am still breaking them in so I expect they will feel even better soon.  I really like the zip up feature on the side of the boot.  This is my first set of tactical boots, I bought these to take tactical training with, but they are so nice I will probably wear them on the weekends also.  I did see some glue between the sole and cloth parts of the boot, but I think this just may be excess.  They do come with a one year manufacture warranty so I am hoping they last, but the warranty gives you some reassurance.  The price on these is why I bought them, I don't wear boots like this on a regular basis, so I didn't want to spend a lot on boots.  I will post a update in a few months. I wanted to wait until after I wore these boots out to write a review so here it is 5 months later. When I first ordered these boots I was very impressed by the comfort of the fit, the to had plenty of room and they didn't hurt my feet either. One of the best features of this boot is the zipper on the inside which allows you to quickly remove and put on the boots. This zipper is great if you have to remove your shoes to enter a customers home or simply if your sick of lacing up boots every morning. After about 2 weeks the yellow top layer of the insert started to roll up inside the boot so I removed it, I'm typically very hard on boots so it didn't bother me that this piece failed. Sweaty feet or any number of things could have cause the glue to fail so I don't blame them. After a few months I burnt one of the laces with a stray welding spark so I had to replace them, again no fault of theirs. Finally on month 5 the sole started to separate from the front of the boot and the right side of my right boot had a blow out. I haven't ever owned a pair of boots that lasted for more then 6 months and even though these only made it through 5 months I'm going to order another pair. For the price and also the zipper I would recommend this to anyone.",1,1

"UPDATE: my granddaughter loved getting this at college on her birthday! Next best thing to being home. I was torn between sending salty or sweet. This sweet AND salty sampler was the perfect solution. I've ordered this on 2 separate occasions now for my USMC son on deployment. There's a nice assortment & variety of items included and everything seemed to be fresh (nothing especially old/stale) when it got to him.  The ""Hangry Kit"" box is much sturdier than I'd expected and would probably ship well on its own, especially when shipping to APOs/FPOs, though I typically throw it in a USPS flat-rate box. I purchased this product for shipment to my Great Grandson who is serving his country overseas. The selection of goods involved in the package is a delight and good tasting, with a sufficient life span to be received overseas. I intend to purchase more of this from this Hangry Kits as time  allows. Thank you for providing a selection of your products. If you know someone who gets ""hangry"" then this is a great gift for them, if you get ""hangry"" yourself then this is a great buy! I purchased my first kit for my husband (the healthy snack one) and it is great! All name brand yummy snacks, he keeps it at his desk and he has enjoyed many delicious snacks. I was so impressed with the value of the kit I purchased the sweet and salty for a gift for a friend and he loved it! The concept is fun, it's a great conversation gift and it is a great value for the price. Great item, great value, I will be purchasing more in the future, great gift idea! My son loves this kit! Second time I've sent it. Nice to have option like this when he's in college in another state and I can click a button and send him a surprise!!  Happy son - happy mom!! Sent this to my daughter at college as a surprise. She really liked it! The box itself made her laugh! She said there was a great assortment inside and was very happy. I admit, I have not sent one to myself - I've sent many packages to family to brighten their day.  And it has worked!",1,1
"A bright and colorful tribute to the psychedelic 60's, this long-sleeve tee fits perfectly and is as bright as any tie-dye item I have ever owned. It is a soft but substantive 100% cotton and feels quite comfortable. My wife's first comment on seeing it on me was, ""I guess you want to be noticed!"" I suppose she is, at least in part, correct. More than that - there is a part of me still wedded to the ideals, values and efforts of the 1960's that I am proud to say I participated in - AND remember! I love my shirts!  They are of the highest quality 100% cotton.  The colors are breathtakingly beautiful.  I grew up in the 60's and have been collecting tie-dye shirts since then, and these are the very best of any I've seen or bought.  I am wearing one now (I ordered myself four), and are seriously considering ordering four more tonight!  Then I will have eight, and should be set for life.  These are the only long sleeve ones I have in all my collection, you very rarely see long sleeve tie-dye shirts.  These are high quality and super comfy....5+ stars from me Bring back the 60's with these fabulous Tie-Dye t shirts. The colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect. I ordered many colors and I love wearing them with my jeans that are destroyed . The shirts are must haves and they complete my wardrobe. Good quality fabric and coloring job.  Additionally, it holds color well when washed.  This was originally purchased as part of a Halloween costume, but it has become a favorite for everyday wear. Runs true to size. It washed beautifully and did not run or shrink.  I cut strips and fringed the bottom to wear at a party with a hippie theme. It came out great. If you do this, don't cut off the hem. Nice bright colors and very good quality. Ordered a medium but fit more like a large. Washed well. Quality shirt, loved the colors. Banded cuff on one sleeve was approx. 1/4 inch longer than the other. Manufacturer flaw.  Seller communication above and beyond expectations. Very happy with end result. A gift and was loved.  It fits loose as I ordered a size larger.  Just what I wanted.",1,1

"I love these versatile earnings. I have had so many compliments on them. I like to wear one in my cartilage and the other side n my lower lobe. I have found several different ways to use them and I bet there are more I haven't discovered. I wear them most of the time now. Love these ear crawlers and have gotten many compliments over the last week! Like most I've tried the backs seem a little flimsy but the plastic backing help to keep them in place and they're holding up really well. They're easy to wear dresses up or down and compliment any outfit. Also comfortable and don't irritate my sensitive ears. I love these earrings! I actually have now ordered them three times. One pair for myself which I lost one of and one pair for my daughter. And then a third to replace the ones I lost. They are so cute and go with everything. I practically wear them every day Nice quality, simple and elegant design.  Takes a little practice getting in place, but once I did, is fine.  I can even sleep in these and they stay in place.  A couple of times during the day, I need to push a little back into place but they do not get to the point where they are hanging down. Just bend ever so slightly to get the back into the right position on your ear.  Love these and get lots of compliments on them. These earrings/ear climbers are awesome!!  They were a tad tricky to get in the first time, but once I had them on they looked Great- very unique!  Adds a bit of edge to a regular outfit.  I get lots of compliments on them and asking where I got them.  I was concerned they wouldn't be very noticeable, but they definitely are visible and make a statement. Very cute, but fragile. They bent the second I took them out of the package. Don't stay in place all that well because the back metal is so flimsy. When I can get them to stay in place, they look great... I had always wanted a crawler and they are exactly as photographed, however the backing pins bent very easily and I cannot use them. I am beyond the return period and stuck with them. I wish I could return them and get my money back. They also would not hold in place. My ears are just as normal as any other. I would not recommend these due to the weak posts that are too pliable. They will break. Loving this Ear Climber so far. I bought the gold one. I've been complimented several times. The product is true to the picture.",1,1
"Delivery was fast, company was instantly responsive, and set-up was very simple and quick (100% assembled in less than 10 minutes).  Most importantly, it's a great product!  I've been vermicomposting for many years and this is the best worm bin/bag that I've used (comparing to the Worm Inn, Worm Factory 360, and oodles of DIY Rubbermaid totes).  It's simple enough for beginners; the breathable mesh sides all but eliminate the problem of over-wetness, which is what dooms many first-timers. I have used a Worm Inn for years, and despite getting good production out of it, I always thought it required too much ""maintenance"" - i.e., constantly having to flush water to keep it moist, adding a barrier (garbage bag) over the top to reduce evaporation, etc.  The Urban Worm Bag does a much better job of retaining just-enough-but-not-too-much moisture so it doesn't need all that extra attention.  I haven't harvested from it yet, but the zipper mechanism at the bottom seems like a vast improvement over the Worm Inn too. Very excited to get more experience with this product and strongly recommend that you give it a try too! I am absolutely in love with this product. First impression: Very attractive packaging and the assembly was very easy, taking me less than 10-15 minutes. I filled with bedding first and then a few days later, I put about 2 lbs of worms in the Urban Worm Bag and they appear to be doing very well so far. The Urban Worm Bag arrived about two weeks ago and so far I'm loving it! The box was awesome (I still can't throw it out!), and the instructions were super simple and easy to follow. It's a really attractive design and one heck of a conversation starter! This is the second Urban Worm Bag I have purchased. I am really impressed with how much surface area this bag has. I was hesitant at first about the zippers, but they are easy to zip and unzip, and there is a lifetime guarantee on them, so you can’t go wrong.  I like the sturdy metal frame and sturdy connectors. And I put it together in less than 10 minutes. It is that easy. Very responsive seller, too. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a sturdy, well-made product. It's exactly as advertised. I've had the bag a week now. There have been no attempted jail breaks from the worms, so they must like the environment. Today I decided to take a temp and humidity reading inside and outside the bag. In my home it's around 15% humidity and 69 degrees. Normal for Las Vegas. Inside the bag it was 71 degrees and 67% humidity! Unlike most worm-farmers, dryness was my biggest worry, so I think your bag works great for me in our arid climate. I've finally located my Las Vegas worm guy, so I may see if I can't do it outdoors since his worms can definitely take the heat! Compared to other similar designs, this is overall superior. It’s extremely sturdy and feels well made. I think some design changes would make this even better but overall it works very well.",1,1
"What they sent is NOT what they show. The classic in the purple box has a much better flavor than the Earl Grey in the light tan box. It's okay and pleasant. I know the difference because my son brings me the purple boxed Twinnings Earl Grey from England, which has a much better flavor. I thought finally, they had made this variety available in America so I don't have to have my son stock pile it for me. Wrong. What I ordered is not what I got. The tan colored Earl Grey would get 3 stars (it's okay), but the it's disappointing when the Purple Box (and the stronger tea inside) is not what they send.. I'm keeping it because I make iced tea with it. Last year I gave up all carbonated beverages and all caffeine. Since I find juices and sports drinks too acidic, that left me with milk and water to drink. After a while I was longing for something different, and I surely missed my sweet tea. On a whim I bought a box of Twinnings Rooibos from the local grocery store one day. Wow! What a great tea! We love Earl Grey tea. We drink quite a bit of it, hence ordering 100 Bags at once. We have had a few different brands of Earl Grey, and there's a couple things that set Twinings apart from their more affordable competition. EDIT: I've found that this tea is much more enjoyable if I drink it cold. What I simply do is just brew a cup as I'd normally do but let it cool. I then dump it in my water jug that has one packet of True Lime and one slice of lemon already in it. This is my favorite cold tea, ever!  Brewed tea can be strong if not brewed properly but cold brew tea is a snap and perfect everytime!  I love that I don't have to sweeten this tea because it has a hint of citrus in the bag.  I also found that you can't over brew this tea.  I put it in a large jar to brew the night before and it is ready when I want it in the morning.  Some days it sits in the refrigerator with the tea bags still in the jar and taste wonderful!  Love this tea! Very mild flavor. No comparison with Bigelow brand. Like some others have already validated, there is very little flavor in these bags. In fact even two or three of these just cannot provide the color and flavor of one Bigelow.",1,1

"Husband got me this for Christmas. I have a nice standard neck strap, but after having my camera hang why we are out on hikes taking photos my neck gets sore.  I can truly say I love this new strap.  I can't even feel my camera hanging. Camera is easy to pull up to take photos, or let rest hanging down while hiking.  Standard shoulder straps don't work for me as I have RA.  I needed something that wasn't going to ride over my shoulders and this strap did the trick.  My only regret is not getting this sooner.  Easy on and off. This thing is great. I'm a day hiker, but I was getting annoyed with lugging my huge camera bag with me everywhere, plus it was digging into my neck and the plastic was making a horrible squeaking noise with every step. I finally decided to buy this harness after seeing a similar product's facebook ad - but this one was much cheaper. It works great; the only downfall is no quick-release setup in case you need to remove the camera for high/low shots. That was easily remedied by a quick run to ACE hardware and a couple small carabiner-type hooks for the ends. It's very comfortable to wear. Highly recommend! I bought this thinking it would be a better strap for hiking and hurt my neck less versus the little neck strap that came with my DSLR.  Mostly, it fits that bill.  It has adjustments on the shoulder straps and in the camera attachment straps, but I still couldn't get it to hold the camera any higher than my belt line which is awkward while hiking.  It might be because I'm tall and slender.  I also think this may not be comfortable for more buxom gals as the straps may be uncomfortable coming across the chest.  The quick connect buckles are nice for putting the strap on and off, but I didn't like how there was very little strap for me to loop around my wrist to secure my camera when I had to detach both buckles to hold the camera away from my body for that special shot.  Overall, I will keep this strap for use while hiking but will find something else for general camera use. I love this harness!!!  I have trouble with headaches stemming from arthritis in my neck, so thought I’d give this a try.  It’s perfect!  I feel no weight on my neck or even my shoulders for that matter!  The weight of my camera is so evenly distributed that I really feel no weight at all.  The thick straps are super comfortable.  The whole unit looks a little daunting at first, but I slip it over my head without even taking my camera off!  However, when my hubby wants to take pictures, I just unsnap at the camera and hand the camera to him without removing the harness! This is pretty neat - great for hikes or other long outdoor activities because it distributes the weight, is cushioned, the camera can come off easily if need be, easier to protect your camera than a crossbody strap, and you can put a backup memory card and battery in the little pockets so you don't need a bag.  I wore this across the Tongariro crossing in New Zealand.  Would be pretty dorky to walk around the city with, but that's not what I bought it for. These are wonderful. I've added offshore ball bearing swivels to a couple of them, I have 5 or 6 of them now and when I have 45 hundred dollars hanging around my neck that is HEAVY! I feel secure and safe with them. Just wish I could get the right clips. I've ordered 6 of them from amazon before figuring out their part numbers are switched. Super great product and the main thing in my set up. Distributes the weight well, no more achy neck and no more shifting from side to side like with a conventional neck strap. It took some adjusting to customize the fit, but seems to be secure and staying put at where I set it. I didn't need the 2 metal rings. I check periodically to be sure the tension is not slipping from either of the loops where it attaches to the camera because my camera with some of my lenses is weighty; so far so good! I've been trying a variety of harnesses for carrying a camera with a very heavy telephoto lens.  I did not find this to be very comfortable and have settled on a harness with a single shoulder strap, allowing the camera to hang at my hip.  This product might be very good for a lighter camera with a standard lens.",1,1
"Happy with this great price on this really nice machine WITH a touch screen.  Most others were priced much higher with a TS!!  So far so good and is running a light show at a nightclub! Very light weight. The touch screen is nice. Not the greatest processing unit. I do not game on it. Just a general pain in the butt when it comes to working with anything complex. Cannot stand the constant pop-up notifications trying to sell me crap from HP. So far so good.  Has been fast so far for office type work, keyboard is comfy and easy to type on.  Touchpad is not overly sensitive.  Battery life has been good so far. I upgraded my parents from an old tower computer system. I had recommended this laptop to them as I had purchased one for myrself and one for my husband. It was easy to set up and they are happy with it so far. It was a good choice for the price and meets their computer needs. I also purchased a wireless computer and a 4-TIG external hard-drive for additional file storage. The entire set up for my parents (laptop, printer, external hard-drive) cost less than $800.00! My parents are the typical ""computer-challenged"" Senior Citizens, so the HP system needed to be simple for them to use. So far, they are very happy with their new set up and it takes up SO MUCH less space, while also providing mobility around the house! Excellent laptop computer great for home office or personal use.  Excellent shipping product is as advertised. Excellent value My HP laptop is now an HP doorstop. I bought my wife one of these less than two years ago at BestBuy. She uses it a few times a week sitting on the sofa, Keyboard doesn't work, touchscreen keyboard doesn't work, external USB keyboard doesn't work. Reinstalled the Window 10OEM, still doesn't work. HP Customer Support doesn't support customers, lots of questions and can't get a person on the phone. By a Dell, Lenovo or an Acer.",1,1

"So, not so funny story: Someone in the apartment unit above us got STABBED. According to the cop who interviewed us, the attacker rang the upstairs doorbell, and when the guy answered the attacker forced his way in and stabbed the guy. You want to know what scary part is? I didn't hear a thing, thanks to my amazing HyperX Cloud 2 headphones. I got them on Amazon for $99.99 (free shipping). These things work as advertised! Probably the best noise cancelling headphones I've ever owned. 10/10 would buy again.

"I am a 10.5 standard on all of my shoes.  These fit exactly as expected.  All of my previous golf shoes have been your basic ones by Footjoy, Puma, etc.  You just kind of expect a golf shoe to not be very great to walk in.  These shoes are a comfort level above those.  These feel just like having a good pair of tennis shoes on.  I can see myself having no problem walking 18 holes in these.  They have decent arch support ( and room to put in an insert if needed).  They are bright white, which might end up being a problem after a few rounds - we'll see how they do with grass stains. I was hesitant to buy these shoes online before trying them, but I relied on the fact they were Adidas and most of the review were positive. These are incredible comfortable and well constructed shoes. I am typically a 13 or 14 in sneakers but I ordered a 13.5 in these since most golf shoes I find are narrow. I don't have a wide foot, but almost every other golf shoe I tried on was to tight in a 13 and to big in a 14. They have well placed mesh vents on the front that increase the comfort level when walking on the course. I think these fit true to size and I highly recommend them. As a bonus, its said delivery wouldn't be for at least a week and I received these on a Sunday 3 days after I ordered them! These are a little tight, but I wear sandals most of the time so my feet have spread some.  I originally ordered by regular shoe size (9.5) but those were not wearable they were so tight.  So I tried the 10.0M and they did the trick.  I feel that they may be making a minor difference in my game.  When I'm in the tee box, I feel that I'm more firmly grounded than when I was wearing sneakers.  Definitely a good value purchase. I've been golfing since I was twelve years old. A lot of my friends have always been more ""serious"" golfers. I took a 12 year break from golfing (by the way, that's not good for your game). I started golfing again in charity tournaments 4 years ago, my game is slowly coming back. I always thought that ""golf shoes"" were a hoax that got people with too much money and too much time and too much pride in their game to spend more money. Well, I was wrong. These shoes actually significantly improved my game. Bought these shoes for playing Cricket(not golf).  Good for the wet conditions in the Pacific NorthWest where normal cricket shoes wouldn't provide enough grip. Comfortable golf shoe. Great so far. I ordered them a half size up to allow for room in the toe box. I play from a cart, so I don't spend a lot of time walking, but I don't notice any discomfort from the spikes while I'm on my feet. They are hard to keep clean, but maybe I just need to stay out of the bunkers ;-). I would consider buying these again. These WOULD have been a really nice, comfortable pair of golf shoes IF the manufacturer had put an insole in them that wasn't as flat as Kansas.  I'm talkin no arch support at all.  Zero.  Nada.  But they were rather cheap golf shoes, so I guess you get what you pay for.  If I keep them (the top parts are pretty comfortable) I will have to put an orthotic insert in them.  I can't stand to wear any shoe that doesn't have good arch support. These are amazing shoes and fit exactly as I expected. They as breathable as flexible as most running shoes. They are a little on the heavy side which is to be expected with golf shoes so it isn't an issue. I also love the replaceable spikes. I tested these under running water for a water and they didn't get wet at all on the inside.",1,1

"OK, HERE IS A HONEST REVIEW OF THE COPPER CHEF.  GOT IN MAIL, I WAS SO EXCITED.  PANS COOKED WELL,  CLEANED UP QUICKLY, AND COOKED EVENLY FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS.  NOW, BOTTOMS ARE BLACK, EVERYTHING STICKS AND I SEE SOME COPPE CHI[[ING ON TOP OF PAN RIMS.  DONT GET ME WRONG, I STILL LIKE THEM, I JUST DONT LOVE THEM.  IT NOW BURNS FOOD AND GETS HOT IN THE MIDDLE BUT NOT ON THE SIDES (WHEN I USE THE INDUCTION COOKER THAT CAME ""FREE"")  COOKS A LITTLE MORE EVEN ON THE GAS STOVE.  I SORTA EXPECTED THE CHARRING ON THE OUTTER ASPECTS OF THE PAN, BUT I CANT CLEAN IT OFF FWITHOUT COMPROMISING THE COPPER LOOK.  WHAT I DO NOW IS WHILE THE PAN IS STILL HOT AFTER COOKING I ADD A LITTEL SOAPY WATER TO THE PAN AND LET IT SIT.  THIS AIDS IN LOOSENING UP THE STICKY CONTENTS.  I HOPE THIS HELPED.  THE INDUCTION COOKER IS A KEEPER :) Awesome Cooking Experience! ORDERED FOR A FRIEND AND SHE LOVES IT! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product Pans work ok. Heat up nice and evenly but are very hard to keep clean. And the non stick is a joke. Lasted like 2 weeks. AOK. This was one of the best buys I have made we love them They are a piece of  over price junk. I got them a month a go and use the frying pan to make bacon, wash the pan as instructed by the book and the lining of the pan is peeling off  already. I am afraid to use the rest of the set . They  are nice to look at.",1,1

"Samsung's new portable SSD brings some new technology but similar performance to their prior (and excellent) T3 drive. The T5 is one of the first consumer products with a new 3D NAND technology where the chip is constructed vertically to allow for more storage density in small form factors. It also has a faster USB interface versus the prior edition drive. A little while ago a buddy of mine bought a 2TB Seagate external hard drive for his Xbox One and told me about how much faster he loads into games now.  He plays Battlefield and Destiny and says he's the first to load into maps nearly every time.  If you've played Destiny, then you know the load times suck going to/from orbit pretty much anywhere, and Battlefield maps can take a while some times, so having an external hard drive shave that time down by any amount is much appreciated. Kinda stinks knowing how much I paid for the 1TB version of this, and how in a year or two the cost of such a thing will probably be half of what I paid for it, but at least this little thing is a pleasure to use in the meantime. It comes with two USB cables, one standard USB to USB-C, and the other is just USB-C to USB-C - so no matter what type of connections you have, you're covered. The cables even come with velcro straps attached. I work in IT and I keep this thing with me everywhere I go, and it's always loaded up with a few useful tools. It's incredibly small, doesn't weigh much, but still feels durable in the metal housing. Great product. This thing is sooooo fast!.  I havent gotten the claimed 540 MB/s, but i regularly see 485 plus!  VERY PLEASED with the performance.",1,1
"This men's wide brim sun hat is functional, lite weight, not exactly stylish but comfortable with a wide brim (4"" front & back, 3 3/4"" on the sides).  The brim is also firm but flexible. I own several other brimmed sun hats but most only have a 2' or 3"" brim. Either the brim is too small or it's huge and floppy. I just recently got this hat and so far, I like it. This is a great hat!  Light weight and wide brim will keep the sun off. Warning, this deliver only includes a hat. The buff unshaven stud is not provided with the hat. The package label should be more clear: ""Buff stud model not included!"" My daily hat is a Sunday Afternoons Sun Tripper hat, but I needed something that offered better sun protection for tropical vacations. I have short hair, so my scalp, neck, and ears would usually burn after a few hours of exposed sun. I was looking for a decent looking hat that provided ventilation, looks good, and most importantly shields my 3 regions mentioned above. This hat has a wide brim that will definitely protect my skin from the sun, and also has a mesh area on top to help with ventilation. I think this hat looks good, but my wife disagreed. Another welcomed feature was that the hat did not have a floppy brim, but it was still packable without losing its shape. My wife gives the hat 4 stars due to it not being stylish, but it’s my review and I like it…so 5 stars! Love the hat!  The brim is flexible, but not flimsy. Bang for your buck it does the job. Has a little over hang which I like. Protected from the sun. I like it because the band is not shrinking from sweat like a lot do. I use it for landscaping and it kept me cool in Texas sun! This hat is lightweight, breathable, the brim is long enough to shield your eyes even during sunset without having to tilt your head down. Sweatband is thick enough to absorb moderate sweating. The brim is moderately stiff, not floppy but not super stiff, like a cowboy or straw hat's brim would be. The ventilation isn't for show, when there's a small breeze, you can feel it hit your head. After seven hours working outside, it's superior to a baseball cap. Sweat does begin to show on the top (not the brim) but the light thin material allows it to dry quickly. I've got a wider head and this fits nicely. Overall, very happy with this hat. My dad loves this hat!  Perfect for and gardener or otherwise outdoor person in your life!  He wears hats like this year round and he needed new ones this one was a great choice! This one has a very wide brim for even more sun protection, which is most definitely the goal when looking for a gardening hat. It also is UPF 50 which provides great protection levels in itself.",1,1
"Very lightweight. Mine came with a few divets and pits in it.. It was in the finish. Other than that the wood is a lot darker in person. On October 31st it will be my husband and I 5th wedding anniversary! Traditionally your 5th needs to incorporate wood, I had no idea how to do that until this ring popped up on my Amazon page. I was so excited when I seen it and just knew that this ring was going to be his gift! Well, this was a surprise!  My husband of 30 years lost his original band after a 25-pound weight loss.  So sad, but we wanted to get him one that matched his personality and wouldn't be expensive if he lost it.  It's so much more attractive than we thought it would be, and is comfortable to wear.  I'm thinking of buying a couple more against the day that this one gets lost! Very happy with this purchase! I have recently lost a significant amount of weight and my original wedding band was simply falling off my finger. It was a basic band that didn't cost much so adding metal to it didn't seem worthwhile. Great looking ring, especially for the price. Purchased this for my husband for Christmas along with a smaller one for me to match. He has not tried it on yet for me to tell if the sizing is true, but mine from the same vendor fit perfectly. These are back up rings to our actual wedding bands so we do not mess them up at work. Really cannot beat it for the price. Very nice looking ring I have had this ring for almost 3 years and never take it off. My first worry was how it will hold up with my life style. I work long hours and always use my hands I thought this would be replaced down the road boy was I wrong! I don’t always use gloves and this ring still looks great up close. The only worry I still have is it falling off when my hands are really cold. I know guys that paid over $500 on similar rings but they don’t compare to the quality this ring provides. I would get another one if mine ever got lost because I know it won’t get damaged. Super surprised at how nice this is. Ordered for my husband for our 5th anniversary (which is wood). The little velvet bag it comes with is a little cheesy, but I ordered a little wooden box from Amazon to put it in (keeping with the wood theme). The ring had no flaws, it is lightweight and super comfortable. It truly looks like it cost WAY more than 12.99!!  It is also very different looking and unique. Would definitely recommend and would buy again! Absolutely love the look and feel of this ring. I waited a couple weeks to post to see how it hold up and so far it has been great. My wife had bought me a silver band for a wedding ring, but it must have had nickel so it irritated my skin. Now, I just wear that one for special occasions after having her coat the inside with clear nail polish.",1,1

"very disappointed I think the description should have mentioned that it's only for 1 time use it's very poorly made really difficult to pour the liquid out of without getting the rest of it wet and since it's made out of very thin cardboard it was a mess. My daughter, who is a medical resident, had to work all night on her 30th birthday. I bought the server so that I could bring her and her co-workers some coffee to go with her birthday cake. The server is sturdy and kept the coffee warm for the drive up there and later into the night. It was easy to assemble and the little piece that slips over the handle was perfect for holding paper plates and plastic cutlery. I was going to buy 2 of those reusable hot beverage storage containers. These worked great.  Although not reusable as it is nearly impossible to wash out and get the bladder completely dry to avoid mold. these were hard to transport and pour from, otherwise as expected Arrived on time. Worked well, unfortunately one of them popped and hot water for tea was leaking out.",0,0

"Very pretty little earrings! I always go for leverback styles, otherwise dangling earrings tend to work their way free and before I realize it, I've lost one. The leverback is sturdy, not thin wire like you sometimes get with fashion jewelry.  The gold here is a dark tone, which I think lends the earrings a nice vintage vibe. These are really pretty and look more expensive than they cost. My only criticism is that the hook part is a bit short, so if you have fleshy lobes the fit can be snug. These earrings are very lovely. Nice color, design and well made.  Great price too. They are not nicely packaged though so if it's a gift, you'll have to supply a box. No problems with the clasp working but one does have to more attentive when putting them on to make sure the two pieces are lined up. I don't have as much trust in their locking ability as other designs but... so far so good and I've worn them all day several times.  I think they are very nice looking - the stone is beautiful and the metal work nicely done.  They don't seem small to me at all... just regular sized (another reviewer thought them tiny). I purchased this as a gift for my wife. She really liked the design and they look more expensive than they are. These are light weight no tugging on ears yet heavy enough to not bend easily . Look much more expensive than they were . Always a fan of Napier I am very happy with these earrings.  When I received them, the outside circle was less black than shown in the picture, but they are stunning, and what I like most about them is the sensible lever back that keeps the earring on the ear.  I have lost so many earrings that have only an open hook!  They sparkle very nicely and they are just the right size for me. Ordered these earrings as a gift. They're just the right size- not too small and not too big.  Understated yet sparkly.",1,1

"Pretty nice quality hat for a cheap price. With the help of some heat transfer vinyl and my Silhouette machine, it made a great Wayne's World hat for Halloween. Party on Wayne! They say you can't put your feet in the same river twice, and I guess that's true of heads and hats too. The first time I ordered this hat it was great - fit nicely around the head, high quality, durable, and good color. But eventually that hat got too worn, so I ordered some replacements. The replacements were not the exact same hat, and didn't fit quite as well especially in the back. But I figured they were still fine so I kept them. This time though, I ordered the hats and they were completely different - these were ""structured"" hats with a completely different look and fit. Still quality, but not the same as the hat I had ordered before, and not something that I want to wear. I don't know if this is the supplier's fault or Amazon's, but who to blame is irrelevant. Product consistency is important, so these hats are going back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! This product arrived, I will say, in an almost timely fashion, that's the reason it gets a star. I received an email it had shipped then a week later another email it was being picked up by the carrier. It sat in some port in Hong Kong for a WEEK before it was picked up for delivery. Believe me, I kept trying to track it to no avail that whole week. When it arrived, it looked good and fit fine but they STUNK!! Even after airing them for a week, tossing them in a dryer with a fabric softener (which I'll admit they survived) and spraying them with a deodorizer, they smelled like fish. I wore one for a few hours and my hair smelled like fish. Really. Don't. Buy. Go to Michael's. they have nearly the same thing for half the price. Hat fits really good.  The color I purchased was black and the color is a deep black which I really liked.  It has Velcro straps used to tighten the hat on the back.  It sits low on the head at just the right angle.  It's 100% polyester which isn't my favorite material.  The smell isn't my favorite either.  You will know when you buy it but once it's broken in the smell will go away.  The price is good and the quality of the hat is probably better than most of you $20+ hats.  Just buy one of these hats or buy one in every color.  By far the best hat purchase I ever made. This hat is probably a factory QA reject (which might explain the price).  The seam in the front of the hat isn't even close to being centered on the bill.  The description should note this. I bought two of this cap about a year ago.  I forgot to review them, but if I had, I would have given them five stars, but no longer. The reason for purchase: I love to play sport and stay in shape. For seven years I played softball at a very high level. Now I play Golf, tennis and run outside. I purchased this cap for running. Good solid hat, not floppy or cheap at all. Got it for me to use when I jog in the morning. I'm a female with a small head, so it was a little big on me but tightened up just fine. Good product for the value!",1,1
"These sneakers exceeded my expectation. Very good all around workout sneaker  immediately noticed I could firmly plant my feet while lifting and comfortable enough for cardio equipment These shoes are great but be aware that they run small.  Reading the other reviews, I went a half size bigger when I ordered and it still wasn't enough.  I had to return those for a full size larger.  But once those arrived the fit was fantastic.  They support well and are comfortable. I love UA shoes and have several pairs.  The Micro G are my favorite for casual wear.  These fit as expected, but are a little tight across the bridge of the foot.  Not enough for me to send them back, but if I was trying them on at the store along with another pair of UAs, I would probably have gone with the other pair. overall good value and comfortable. Ankle support is good. I'm a size 9 1/2 and bought the 10. I should have returned it for the better size, these run a little small. Would have been better with 10 1/2 Love the shoes. I already had a pair in a different color that I bought at a sporting goods store, I just wanted a different color combo for different outfits I wear. So I already knew what size to get. They do run pretty small, so I’d get a full size larger than what you normally wear. As far as quality, durability, comfort, etc., they’re great shoes. I stand all day at work, and these are the most comfortable shoes I’ve found so far. 5 stars, just remember to size up when you order. As others have noted, this regular D or Medium size, UA seems to fit smaller and narrower , than needed. I'll have to return them and I don't see this seller as anything extra wide to try. ; / Nice sneakers, my kid loves them. Ordered them for me....but these fit at least a 1/2 size smaller than the size they are labeled. I usually wear size 10, which actually gives me a little toe wiggle room.  These Under Armour size 10 fit like a snug size 9.5 I love these workout shoes. I've used them in the gym, on deployment, and they've held up nicely over time. They're not as torn up other gym shoes that I've had for a shorter amount of time. The fit was fine and has more cushion than others. Under armour makes a very good shoe and boots to boot.",1,1
"I was skeptical I would actually like this hat as the only baseball cap I had at the time of purchase was a structured one. Unable to find a cute structured one I gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and especially the fit. I'm 49 and still, like to look cute when (if) possible but mostly this is for sunscreen. I didn't do my hair all pretty for the pics I wore it like I usually do when I'm outside doing yard work or going for a walk to exercise. So the hat may look a little askew but keep in mind my thick braid on one side. Also, I have a small head. The color is true to the photo, but the fit is rather wide. It isn’t as rounded near the bill and sticks out to the sides more than most baseball hats. For the price, it’s a decent hat but not the quality I was hoping for. I don't wear very many hats.  Most of this type never seem to fit correctly or the dome is sloppy on my head.  I ordered this to get it embroidered for occasional wear, but decided to try it for size.  I have worn it regularly ever since and have ordered a new one to be customized.  The hat is well constructed and sturdy.  The back adjustment strap is cloth with a metal clasp.  The dome is reinforced to maintain it's shape.  The price is amazing including prime shipping and is half the local prices without shopping.  This is a great inexpensive well-made hat. This baseball is simple yet chic. It fits nicely with adjustable straps. I find baseball caps to be such an effortless element to upgrade your look. I also reach for them when I'm lazy to style my hair. The material is breathable so you can wear it all day. I like the length of the brim, not too long but still keeps the blazing sunshine from hurting your eyes. Awesome hat! I really wanted a nice light gray hat to go with anything, this one fits the bill! It’s very comfortable, good quality, can’t go wrong with this hat! The hat really fits me well, it looks good on me. I know the style is simple but it fits most of my outfits. I can’t really get rid of it. Now it became my everyday wear on. This style has so many other colors but I like the black one cause it looks nice. Quality and comfortable!!The adjustable strap is really nice and tightens to my own liking, which is exactly how I expected the hat to fit. The color is even better than the picture, as well. For the price of this hat you would think you're ""getting what you paid for"". I ordered two of these, one grey, one black. The grey one was as expected, a low profile cotton hat, the black one is a totally different brand and not a low profile hat as advertised, it's a regular high profile baseball style hat.  So I ordered 2 of the same item, except for color, but received 2 totally different products.",1,1
"First off, the Ring is very cool. I really like it and many people  that come to my front door (salespeople) know what it is immediately and don't bother me. There are three problems however, one very serious (in my opinion). So this Ring Video Doorbell worked for about 4 months. I came home one day and the door bell button was stuck in the down position and the unit burned out. I contacted Ring and customer service was receptive and sent me a replacement unit. Unfortunately the replacement unit had trouble connecting to my solid wi-fi and I was directed to reboot the unit by holding down the orange button for 20 seconds. After the unit was rebooted it connected to wi-fi but would not charge or ring my mechanical door chime. My unit was hardwired to my doorbell using a 16 volt transformer and mechanical door bell and the first unit worked fine until it burned out. I spent some time on chat with customer service going through all the troubleshooting when they eventually agreed to send another replacement unit.  Writing this review the morning after it took someone about 20 seconds to disable and steal our Ring Doorbell. Camera triggered too late to get a look at the person stealing it, speaker feature hung up and didn't activate (like usual) and it was gone from my house in a shockingly short amount of time.",-1,-1

"This product, simply put, does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it well. I personally chose this product over other bike mounts on amazon because I didn't totally trust he design of most of the other ones I saw, and this one looked much more solid; I was not disappointed! It holds my phone very well for my purposes. I bike to and from work, all in suburban neighborhoods, so my route is spent all over residential and business streets with bumpy roads and bumpy sidewalks, and it holds up just fine. The clamp that keeps the mount on my handlebars is almost TOO good, as I can't really remove it now that it's on (unless I were to go pry the clip open with a screwdriver). Getting my phone in and out is easy with the use of one clip that allows the top to slide up and down and the band (which is a lot like a hair band) is easy enough to work with and doesn't obstruct my access to the screen much, if at all. Rotating the phone is worryingly easy to do, the mechanism just feels a bit weak when you do this, but don't worry too much about it; so far the force of bumps in the road have not been enough to turn it; it still does take me doing it by hand. If you want a magnetic stand, this one has the strongest magnet out of the three I have tried. Therefore it's best for large phones. The strength of the magnet makes it possible to tilt the phone into different positions without it inadvertently detaching from the mount. The strong magnet also means that this unit works well with your phone still in a case. And the stand looks good too (I got the dark colored one). A couple things about this mount: I liked it when I got it as a replacement for another brand of magnetic mount that didn't stay ""stuck"" to the dash. While both brands have problems staying stuck when driving in or left in direct summer sun, this mount's magnetic ""cover (black branded circle) keeps slipping down and isn't useful for me. The other mount I have has a magnet completely enclosed in permanent material. While I think the suction on this mount is better than the other brand, I now have had to use this as the secondary mount I keep near the cupholders for when driving in direct sun heats up my phone too much. Pic shows slippage after I repositioned ""cover"" several times already. Beautiful to look at, the finish is fantastic. It works well, holds my large iPhone, 8 Plus, steady without issue. Not as big or heavy as you'd think, it's 3-3/8"", 85mm, tall, the base is just 3"", 75mm, around. It only weighs 187g, so it's a little light compared to a phone. I have to pull my iPhone (8 Plus) from the edge to 'peel' it off the magnet, otherwise I pick up the entire stand. I wish there was a larger, heavier version of this, I'm going to try to find another base to glue this to a heavier item. Overall I do really like this mount. I used it to hold my Cop-O-Meter while using a rental truck.  We ended up driving over 1500 miles, and there were very few issues.",1,1

"My daughter is 11 with autism and has loved these water beads. First project she was actually engaged in. We put them in a gallon bucket in the sink and every hour or so she would add more water. She caught on to the concept quickly as she saw them grow. The following morning they overflowed out of the bucket which was fine. We just had to transfer them into a tote for sensory play. Now she plays with them daily in a tote also filled with sea animals. This product exceeded my expectations.  My kids had S blast playing with these and didn't even know it was for sensory therapy.  One note, this package makes a lot of beads once they grow, next time u would use half the package at a time.  And try not to spill, slippery little things😧 These are a super fun sensory experience for my 18-month old.  He has played with them 2 days in a row and really loves it. Unfortunately, they bounce everywhere so it's a bit of a hassle to pick up the beads that bounce in all directions while also making sure my dog doesn't try to eat them!  The first time we played with them, I had to put my poor dog into her crate for her own safety while she watched us play.  Luckily, both my son and my dog learned quickly that the balls are not for eating!  I am a little disappointed that a lot of the balls already started breaking and/or cracking and it's only the 2nd day. But the bag of 4,000 balls will go a long way and it was inexpensive so I'd still recommend. This product is really cool with several different colors. These are funny for kids to spend hours in measuring out and classifying while they are expanded in a clear glass bowl. They enjoy playing with them and I am sure that we will be able to come up with some fun things to do with them. They are good quality as these don’t fade or shrink. It's nice that these are also ideal for our vase filler. Bought these for my 2 year old for sensory play, and she LOVED them. She was engaged from the beginning and loved squishing them, picking them up, burrowing her hands in them. She got great motor skills practice by using pincer grasp to pick them up, and using a spoon to scoop them into jars. A tiny amount of the dry product goes a long way - I used about 1 tablespoon of the dry beads, and once hydrated it filled up a 9x9 baking dish. It can get a tiny bit messy if they escape the container or they get squished, but it's not too bad to clean-up. I even recruited my toddler to help pick them up off the floor, and she got more fine motor practice that way. ;) My kids LOVE these! The envelope comes with so many beads, we will have lots of fun with them. We chose to make a smaller batch the first time and so we ended up with about 6 cups of hydrated beads from about 1 tablespoon of dry pellets. There are so many left over, which is good because all our friends and family want some to take home! The amount that comes is definitely adequate for a large classroom of children or to fill a large plastic storage tub for one kid. The only reason I did not give the final, fifth star is because they break apart so easily once they are hydrated. Every time my kids play with them we lose half a dozen or more to breakage. But since they are so inexpensive and there are so many, it's not a real problem. If we ever run out, or give them all away, we will order again! I bought these for my daughter to use for play.  She loves them (2.5).  She likes the tactile experience and just a few of these goes a long way.  I gave her about a tablespoon of them and they expand and take up much more space.  The beads ended up being a few different sizes.  They are very hard to pick up if you drop them on the floor (because they are slimy) and they break relatively easily if you squeeze them too hard or if you drop it too hard.  But they would be great to use for many different purposes.  Fun for play and appealing to look at for decorative purposes. Great waterbeads, lots of colors in the pack, I made my niece some rainbow sensory bottles with them and they were perfect! Its a small pack, but dont be fooled, these greatly expand, I used a tablespoon and they expanded to completely fill  a 7 cup tupperware container!! Pic: I had extra, so I made a rainbow bottle of them (they look really cool in the light!)",1,1

"BEST freeze dried fruit I've ever had! Bonus...it is ORGANIC!  I've tried plenty of different brands as well as different fruit types.  This is hands down #1.  I know, it is pricey, but quality is worth paying a little extra.  I am on a strict AIP diet since being diagnosed with celiac.  These freeze dried grapes are great for a snack when on the go.  At home I mix it with a coconut yogurt (highly recommend CoYo brand) and just those two simple ingredients make a great dessert.  I buy 12 packages at a time for a great bulk discount! My daughter loves to eat freeze dried blueberries so I order different organic ones and this one was really big and sweet. The reason I gave only 4 starts instead of 5 was due to the blueberry quantity that was in the bag. There was only half full of blueberries in the bag and I wish it there were more for the price. Did you find these because of Danielle Walker? Me too! I love following her and seeing all she posts. When she posted about giving these to kids I was excited! I wish I could give these a better review. They definitely are super tasty and crunchy. There are hardly ANY in the bag though, like seriously maybe an inch or two up from the bottom is all that's filled. I should have measured them poured out with a picture. Just not worth it for the price. These are absolutely delicious! I was surprised how good they are. The only downfall is my husband and I ate the whole bag in one sitting! I wish there were more in each package.  But 100% delicious and only ingredient is organic grapes! I will definitely buy these again!! These were called for in a recipe and so I used them and they were fine.  I prefer fresh but when the recipe calls for these, I'll use this product again. Super sweet. I had to double check to make sure there was no added sugar. I LOVE desserts but know I shouldn't eat them as often as I desire. Luckily these grapes are like candy but I know they're good for me so I don't feel guilty eating an entire bag. :) They aren't cheap but it makes me savor the bag even more ;-) Tastes like candy, perfect texture for a crunchy grape. I use it in place of raisins in my trail mix because despite the health benefits of raisins, they're my least favorite part of any trail mix.",1,1
"Everything I have read and heard about these pans from Calphalon is true!  We bought these because we recently upgraded to a Bosch 800 series induction cook top. Love these pots and pans!! Got the 13-piece set and have more cookware than we know what to do with! Everything seems very well made and have had no real issues with discoloration or staining as others have said. If you are, try cooking with some oil (add before heating) or turning down the heat. My motto with these is 'start low and go slow' as that will prevent burning the food as these things heat up a lot faster and hold the heat a lot better than cheep Teflon pans. If you have issues with food sticking, Bar Keepers Friend will clean these things right up and make them look good as new. We have put some of these items in the dishwasher when we are feeling lazy and have not had any issues. And the handles do not get hot, so no need to worry about that either. Overall highly recommend these pots and pans! Beautiful cookware.my wife and I both love it. There's a learning curve with SS cookware but after the adjustment I'm impressed. Fabulous product at great price (but prices fluctuate widely so be patient & ready to act when they drop). Went from Calphalon anodized classic & professional lines (Without Nonstick coating) which I still love but are showing age. New purchase was partly driven by prospect of going to an induction range and looking for a lighter weight but high quality product. Getting older and managing arthritis and Myositis made some of my larger anodized pots almost unmanageably heavy. Going stainless did mean learning to cook a bit differently but the effort is well worth it and food comes out great no matter what ingredients used (eg., tomatoes). Incidentally I did also add some pieces from Calphalon Signature 5 ply line ...I love those too but found the Tri-ply line lighter weight but just as effective when cooking. I also tried & own a few pieces of Viking Triply and Cuisinart French Classic triply and All-Clad triply... The Caphalon Tri ply set won out because of its relatively lighter weight, effective performance, comfortable handles and affordable pricing. Clearly a Best Buy for me, especially since Calphalon was smart and added ‘assist’ handles on most of the larger pots .... Cuisinart multiclad really missed the boat by omitting assist handles! The All-Clad handles were not comfortable in comparison. Viking Triply although also a favorite was more than double the price for fewer pieces. First, transaction was flawless. A+. Second, like others I am learning to cook without ""teflon"". The test for me is eggs. I have always cooked with gas, but when we vacation and rent cabins or condos they always seem to be electric. Many of them also have stainless cookware. I almost always burned the eggs. Electric + stainless + me = burnt dishes. However, I researched and have learned to pre-heat slowly, moderate the temperature, and utilize a little oil (noting not to use spray oils). I have mastered the eggs! It is like cooking a roux without burning it and getting it just right - it takes time. I have also cooked other dishes with great success. My spouse cooked a dish, but heated it too quickly and without any oil, which discolored the finish. But, no problem, the bar keeper's friend rubbed it right out. I am very pleased!",1,1
"The quality is good. My boy likes it. I read the review and I know I need to order bigger size than normally wear, but it’s still smaller than I expected. My boy is 7 year old, I plan to buy those for him for the next few years so I bought 9-11 year old size. After I washed them, they fit him now. So if you want to purchase them for future years, buy much bigger size. My son feels like a big boy in his underwear. Nice solid colors and breathable material. Great value for the price. This is my second purchase. It's a perfect underwear for my 2,5 years old son. I bought a bigger size because he is a giant. My sons loves these! They are soft to the skin, and keep their stretch. They are not too tight, but not loose so they bunch up. I actually bought two more packs for him because he likes his ""Happy Boys"" so much! I bought these after reading the reviews and I agree with all of the positive posts here. The underwear is very soft and I love that it's 95% cotton and  5% spandex. That makes them so much softer. I bought the size 6-8 years for my 7 year old son and they fit him great even after they were washed and dried. They even have room for him to grow a bit. I love the colors and they look and feel like nice quality boxers. My son loves them too so that's a huge plus in my book. My 6 year old doesn’t like to wear underwear but will wear these. They’re so soft and seem so be comfy and look like they fit well. He says they don’t give him wedgies lol. Amazing! My 9 year old son who has never complained of his previous underwear, told me that he never knew underwear could be so comfortable. They wash nicely and don't stretch out as he wears them. Will definitely be buying more. Good quality and very comfortable. Even after few washes they are still bright and fresh and did not lose the shape.",1,1
"I love these noodles! Since going Paleo it is hard to find an acceptable replacement for noodle dishes and this one measures up! They have the texture I'm looking for and take on the flavor of whatever I pair them with!! I wish I could buy 13 packs at a time, but I don't have the storage space! I've been wanting to make japchae because we love this noodle dish from a favorite korean restaurant.  This brand is really great, I followed the recommended cooking time and rinsed them well in cold water, and left them soaked in cold water while I saute my ingredients.  This process eliminates the starch that makes noodle stick together when they get cold. I love the recipe that I got from you tube where she made the sauce first then everything that followed were individually sauteing ingredients and mixing everything in the end. Try this noodle, excellent quality !!! When I am wanting noodles  in my Asian cooking and want something starchy unlike spiralized, vegetable, noodles for my Paleo dishes this is what I use.  These noodles are great in cold noodle salads and other casseroles. So yummy with spicy fried pork and kimchi! Bought these for my sister who cooks Korean food. They were delicious and authentic. No complaints here. The packaging has different nutritional facts then the advertised product. I believe (especially with food) this should never happen. I liked them. Maybe expected more of a sweet taste because they are from sweet potatoes but they weren't. Still was happy I am totally pleased with these noodles. I'm getting ready to order more! Easy to cook and tasty. These worked great for japchae, just needed to be cut a few times with kitchen scissors after boiling to make them a little more manageable ( and mixable).  Super yummy results!",1,1
"This flavor is amazing. It’s one of the only ways I can drink water- I love that it doesn’t add any calories to the water. Delicious! Delicious flavor and convenient for my bottles of water. Very tasty its flavor is just like pink lemonade Repeat ordering cause I like it. Lovethis flavor Easy to use and very tasty Yummy The taste is great, but it rose my blood pressure through the roof.",1,1
"I love it very sparkley and it hasent gotten damaged at all yet and i beat the crap out of it This is very nice, but my guy friend said it itches their finger.  I bought it because it said hypoallergenic.  However, I suppose it's still irritates some skin.  So if you're highly sensitive to jewelry, you may want to try one that's specifically ""stainless steel"". Great Looking ring also great value for the price Great product. Used as the wedding band and looks like real diamonds. The metal is prone to tiny scratches but cleans up really well otherwise. Definitely buying a couple to have on hand I case I lose one in the future! Just received this and it is a great ring for the price. It is made nicely and has the same comfort fit as my husbands 14K gold wedding band. This will be durable and I will not have to worry about him scratching or denting it or loosing diamonds. It is rugged but classy just like him! It was delivered very quickly, and is a very handsome ring. Great quality Great customer service!! I ordered this ring for my Husband for his wedding ring. The shipping took a little longer than expected and the seller was very good about making that right. When it arrived it was too big so I contacted the seller. He responded very quickly and was very helpful on advising how the sizing works with his jewelry. He worked with us on returning the ring and worked within our crazy schedule with the wedding. It was a perfect fit and definitely looks very nice.  I absolutely love it.",1,1

"I ordered the Medium size for my 19-month-old, 24-lb son. (For sizing, look at the last photo on the product's page). He wears size 4 diapers and wears 18 mo-2T clothes. The training pants are a lot larger then expected. My little one is 38lbs and the extra large come up past his belly button. The leg holes fit perfect but they just seem to long in the top. We are still using them around the house. I don't really see us using these with pants to go out in though. The pants fit a bit lose for my 28 lbs boy. They look very cute. In terms of protection, they are great. Texture is soft and they are relatively thin. Instead of a puppy I got a cat or bunny I'm not sure what it is. I did receive the pink bunny, the fox, and the sheep. But that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars because i didn't get exactly what was pictured. However the other three are exactly like the picture and I love them! They're pretty absorbent and so so cute. My daughter loved picking out which one she gets to wear and it's helped move our potty training along. I wasn't sure what size to order so I got a Large and hoped for the best. I'm glad I didn't get a medium. My daughter is 2 years old and weighs 27 pounds. She wears a size 2t in pants. A 3t is loose on her and sags down as she's walking. The large fit pretty well. The leg holes are snug enough but not too tight and the waist fits well too. I like them because they have a good stretch so I think they could fit her up until she turns 3.  They fit a little like bloomers which I think is pretty cute. I hope this helps when choosing your size. Very cute patterns, and they seem to absorb at least one bladder's worth of accidents. Great quality training pants. I highly recomend to all moms and dads with toddlers! Still battling the potty training nightmare, but these work great for dribbles or small leaks. Not so great for full on peeing, but the do the job! Somewhat large just because our Granddaughter is very small for a two year old.",1,1
"These Hanes cool comfort, microfiber, ultra sleek, no-line and hi-cut panties are the best! I have been wearing them for about 5 years and I am so glad that I discovered them. These seemed slightly small in my regular size compared to other all cotton styles by Hanes.  I like the thinness & silkiness of the fabric.  This is also my favorite cut of underwear - I feel covered/modest (just in case I get into the proverbial car accident!), but not like I'm wearing ""old lady"" briefs! :) They are very comfortable & they slide nicely under clothes.  No problems with riding up either. Good, basic micro fibre Hanes underwear. I don't find micro fiber to be cool or breathable at all... so I find the 'cool comfort' moniker a bit funny. However, when I wear cotton skirts/pants...I'll wear these underneath to avoid that cotton to cotton cling issue. They work great. This may be a bit obvious, but note that if you are used to buying a size up because cotton shrinks... don't do that with these. Microfibre doesn't shrink. So good quality manufacturing, typical fabric, typical function. It's Hanes.... The material is nice, the fit is nice, but the finishing is sub-par.  The elastic edge isn't secure so it began to unravel before they were even worn, (I washed before wearing). Bought these for postpartum and love the comfort so much I'm wearing before baby arrives!  I went up 2 sizes as I'm not a fan of tight fitting undergarments after delivery and these still fit great at 8.5 months pregnant so I'm sure they'll be great for postpartum use as well.  Love the material and they stay up well and don't ride up at all.  Definitely recommend these to any pregnant mama looking for comfort over sexiness in the last few months of pregnancy and the first few months of postpartum! If you love Jockey no panty line briefs, these are similar, for about 1/5 the price.  I've paid as much for one pair of the the Jockeys as I did for a 5-pack of these. I ordered two packages and received on package of all black and one of the assortment shown, which works out pretty much perfect for me because I wear mostly black, but wanted a few lighter colors as well to wear under light colored pants. I give a good rating simply because of the quality. I have been to these for years and love them. Soft, comfortable, smooth fabric. Very stretchy, which means that they fit even if your weight fluctuates a bit.",1,1
"Had the infamous circle with a line through it on my mac and was able to get the problem fixed with this cable. This is the second time since owning my mac that this problem has occurred, so I knew to purchase a cable, rather than attempt to fix/replace the hard drive. The price is right, the installation was pretty simple, and it has worked well for me so far. Hopefully it stands the test of time, but for the price, I have little to complain about it if gives out in a year or two. I recommend this product if your mac won't boot and/or read your hard drive. Make sure you buy the correct cable, so it fits your setup. They have multiple options for this type of cable. I would look at the product number written on the current cable in your computer and buy the one that matches your number. (P.S. It works for my SDD, something I was a little concerned about before purchasing.) It worked but was not a perfect fit. worked perfect for my macbook pro 13"" mid 2010! i upgraded to ssd and purchased this and now i have a faster machine that functions like a brand new laptop. awesome! Fits a macbook pro mid 2011 but is not the same material.  metal is cheap So far, this is working great and my 2012 MacBook Pro is back to working! Cable was about an inch to long. It still fit but doesn't lay flat. This cable is a great replacement.  It is a little long for the MacBook Pro, but it works perfectly. Thank you!",1,1
"I ordered two Samsung Galaxy S3 replacement batteries.  I received two batteries in plastic with a tag labeled ""Samsung Galaxy S3 Replacement Battery (2100 mAh) for AT&T, Sprint & T-Mobile Models - NEW"", but they are NOT.  They are the wrong size (shorter and wider) and do not fit my phone.  When I tried to submit a return or replacement, it says that no returns are available because item is out of stock.  That doesn't make any sense anyway!  Besides, when I went in to purchase another one, it says it is in stock.  I am very disappointed and have lost $20. Amazon didn't like my previous review for some reason (not sure why as it fully met all of their requirements), so I'm trying again. This battery (the one I received since I can't speak for everyone.....) has a life that's *shorter* than the battery I want to replace. It went down 20% in about an hour after I updated a few small apps and viewed a few web pages. It loses juice much faster than it should for a ""new"" battery even when I'm not using the phone and have radio off.  I can't recommend buying this.  Based on reviews I've read it's hit or miss in terms of getting a weak battery or a dud. I suggest buying a battery in such a way that you can guarantee it will be a new, genuine, non-defective battery, whether it be at Amazon or elsewhere. The battery I received doesn't fit at least one of those characteristics, possibly more. I have yet to see if this one has NFC on it.  But I think I should have kept my old battery now.  Now only did my old puffed up battery last longer.  This one came to me dead.  Took a LONG time to charge, and to top it off.  Has about a 2o min runtime.  No joke.  From a 100% charge,  that took almost 2 hours,  you know something was wrong.  And  have a legit 5 amp usb Charger and great samsung cables. I bought this from a company that had the product listed as ""Fulfilled by Amazon,"" and they quickly resolved my problems, less than two hours after I voiced my concerns. This review is just a warning to anyone who might have the same issues. I bought this battery on October 2014, I almost forgot to write this review! The battery didn't fully charge since the beginning, it charged up to ~80% goes down slowly to about 40% and then from 40 to dead in less than an hour!! Which is quite annoying! I did a research on how to figure out if a samsung battery is fake. FYI, take a look at this youtube video (https://youtu.be/2sLhTLLeuvw). This battery is exactly like the fake one showed in this and many other similar video clips. I have attached the photo of the one I bought. Also, the battery bloated after a couple of month of use. I ended up buying another one from ebay this time an original one! I bought this battery on August 6, 2017.  It was ""fine"" for a month or so, but after two months will no longer hold a charge. I have checked my battery charger and it IS charging perfectly.",-1,-1
"Update 02/10/18:  Dropped from 4 to 2 stars--purchased 5 months ago, and Hard Drive failed last week (diagnostics error code 2000-142).  Computer is lightly used, primarily functioning as a print server--HD installed was a Western Digital green, so should not have failed so quickly.  Will buy new HD, reload everything, and have a go at it again.  Still feel a reasonable value, and suspect this can happen when buying a reconditioned unit, but the cost/hassle of repair/reload makes it much less cost effective. Needed a 2nd computer and originally started to resurrect an old Gateway tower with a new motherboard, but wow, the price of this ""refurbished"" Dell just couldn't be beat.  This is a ""business"" computer with only the standard on-board video & audio so wouldn't be for dedicated ""gamers"", but for any other home/student/business use should fill the bill nicely, with an Intel i3 dual core processor, 8GB RAM and a big 2-TB hard drive. There is a single optical drive and USB-2 ports galore, 4 in front and 6 on the rear. There are four low-profile expansion slots so you could jazz it up with a PCI-express video card if better video performance is really needed, and one extra SATA port plus room for another internal hard drive. We had a desktop that was long past what many would consider the life of a computer now days. I have always been a fan of Dell, because I retired from IT consulting, and our company sold Dell. We just always had excellent results with to quality and support from Dell. I wanted a new desktop that had enough RAM that it wouldn't be sluggish in normal everyday use. The Optiplex fit the bill for this. Setup was extremely painless. Pretty much start it up and let it do its thing. We have had it for over a month now, and it is fulfilling all expectations so far. Great deal. Priced right. Excellent product. Plug it in and it works. Can't ask more than that! It's really slooooow....  Need to budget in an addt'l $50 for an SSD. Arrived well packaged, but interestingly, had 3 loose screws floating around inside the case (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  Upon inspection, I found they were motherboard screws either not installed or worked their way loose?  I simply screwed them back into the holes where they belonged, and tightened the other motherboard screws that were securing the board (2 were loose).  Other than that minor issue, the unit fired right up and is performing rock solid.  Will buy more when the need arises -- great deal on for a home workstation. This was the best money I spent all year to buy this computer.  Very happy with the performance. For basic stuff, surfing the Net, checking email, word processing, keeping records it;s a fine machine. Great PC for the few things my spouse does on the PC.  It is fast, no problems loading Windows 10 and they even a keyboard, mouse, and WIFI card.  Beware, Buy Microsoft Office if you need the office software.",1,1
"Sadly I only got to wear it for about two weeks looks great but very poor quality. These bot broke in the same place at the pin. Very disappointing!!! Cute idea, bad execution. Less than a month old and band is peeling so bad it is becoming unwearable - both because it looks bad and because it is next to impossible to get the band and peeling piece through the loop on the band. Waste of money. I will never buy this band again. It was stiff and uncomfortable and luckily I was just sitting down when I looked down and it was broke. I could have lost my $700 investment. It broke on the metal part near the actual face. I bought this for my wife and she was super excited about it, as she is into floral right now.  Her first comment was that it didn't looks like it had a metallic sheen to it online (which it does in person) it looked matte online.  That was the only problem with it till January.  I bought it for her in sept/oct. and in January the clasp broke in half. No repairing that. What a sad waste of money. The bigger issue is that she didn't even break it in well--the band was still stiff because she only wore it 2-3 times a week, and had stopped wearing it because it wasn't forming to her wrist comfortably.  So, it essentially broke after being lightly worn for 2.5 or 3 months.  Not a quality product. Don't waste your money. I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it! It’s decent quality and way better than spending $50 on a Apple brand band...if it ever breaks I can replace it 5 times over before it costing more than the Apple band assuming that one doesn’t break I purchased the band on June 24th and last night (Aug 3rd) the band broke. The metal watch band adapter piece broke off and now the band is unusable. It is a pretty design but the durability is just not there. I loved this, I have not changed this band since I bought it definitely worth it. I wasn't fond of the rubber bands that came with the watch felt very under dressed or sporty when I wasn't trying to be but this band fit perfectly, I have had it for a while now and it's still going strong! I am returning this asap. Poor quality. It popped out of the side clasps, when I tried to remove it from the watch, the very first time! It was also way too big for  a smaller wrist. Material felt cheap, as well.",-1,-1
"I love this shirt! I'd been looking for a nice, loose fitting but flattering basic after pregnancy, and this is perfect. Hides my pooch and covers the butt, so it's perfect with leggings. I'm 5'9"", 160/70 lbs or so (postpartum so who's counting, haha). Great quality-- I love that it's 95% cotton (unlike most things in stores like this nowadays, which are rayon and shrink like crazy!). I washed and dried it in the dryer and no shrinkage. I'm ordering more colors now :D Soft bright color, I order a size medium I mean it's not super $$$$. I ordered a size up as I had seen suggested and many of these type of shirts. So it's a little loose. Which is what I wanted. A bit longer than expected in the front and back but I think that's just the way it's supposed to look. Plus I'm short, 5'4. This is a great shirt! I ordered 2 different colors in the long sleeve and I love them so much that I am thinking of ordering one in the short sleeve. Material is soft and the quality is very nice especially for the price! I absolutely looooove this tope!!  It fits loosely!!  I ordered an XL.  I measure 44 hips, 38 waist and 36 bust and it is perfect!  Doesn't cling and lays nicely!  light weight but still warm!  Love! This shirt turned it so cute it was a lot darker than I expected but I still like it. It fits perfect and it is the perfect length for me so I’m super excited to keep wearing this all winter. Very comfortable. Normally wear a S, ordered a M because of the other reviews. I could’ve probably fit in a S. Didn’t find that it runs big at ALL. Love this shirt!  Perfect with leggings and boots.  Material is nice soft and comfortable.  I’m 5”1, size 4-6 typically and the medium fit perfectly.  Nice roomy, comfy top to wear either dressed up or casual.  Hope more colors get added.  Not fond of the other color selection.",1,1

"This belt is super duper cute and pairs great with a pair of Ted Baker heals that I have with a bow on them. Very cute belt. I added this to a black maxi dress and it looked awesome! Would def recommend this to add a little something to a plain outfit. This is a cute belt, however the color is more of a yellow gold. Love this, so pretty on. It arrived promptly and looked great with my  ""Christmas dress"". Great bargain. Really sweet.",1,1
"I remember when Handi Wipes hit the market, back in the 60s when ""disposable"" was ""in"".  As I got more environmentally conscious, I stopped using them.  Recently, my kids and I revisited that decision.  We looked at how often we washed our dishcloths, how frequently we had to bleach them, how often we had to replace them, how many paper towels it took to wipe up spills, etc.  We realized that this pack of Handi Wipes will last us at least two years, replace rolls of paper towels, and eliminate about a quart of detergent/bleach over that same period.  I'm sure we missed something in our simple thinking, but it seems like in this case the convenient solution makes sense.  I suspect they're made from synthetic fibers, not cotton, but the weight of the whole pack is about the same as a couple of empty detergent/bleach bottles.  These cloths are much more durable than I expected.  We've found them to be a perfect middle ground between stinky dishcloths and one-shot paper towels.  I guess some ideas from the 60s were pretty good after all. I've been using these wipes for probably 30 years, and they are the best. They used to be easily found in the grocery store, but then they stopped keeping them some years ago. I bought a large supply several years ago online, thinking they would last me forever. When I started getting low, I went looking on the internet and found these. I bought them because of the favorable reviews that assured me they were, in fact, the ""original"" Handi Wipes. My husband laughed when he saw how excited I was when they came! I think I'm going to buy another package of 72 so I don't run out for a very long time! These things are amazing. I have thrown away all of my cloths and these are all I use. They are really strong and I use one for about 3-4 days for all of my dishes/kitchen cleaning. I used to use kitchen cloths that I would wash, but they just would get so gross that I looked for an alternative option. This is the best option that I have found, I would recommend them for anyone. I love these and cannot understand why the local stores ever quit stocking them.  As a wife & homemaker over the past 35 years, I have tried just about every type of dish cloth, sponge, scrubber, and dish cleaner ever marketed and I always come back to Handi Wipes.  I like having a fresh, new kitchen cloth each day and having the confidence of knowing I am not simply moving contamination from one area to another when I wipe things. I never worry about staining these cloths or my dish towels because I wipe with these and they are disposable.  I run them through the wash at least once, so I get about 6 months out of this size bag. I'm not sure what I will do if they ever quit making these, I love them that much. I use these for everything in every room and the car. I'm not sure this last bunch are quite as good as they have been in the past. Seems maybe a little thinner. I don't think each one holds up as long as they use to, but they are still better than any others I've tried. I like the fact that they can be thrown away when they get to dirty or thin to use anymore. I don't like cloth dish rags around, they get stinky and stained. These put an end to that. They start out as nice clean dish rags, when older, they graduate down in dirtier jobs until they get too thin to use anymore, so I really get the full benefit out of them. Will no doubt buy them again. It IS a paper towel conspiracy! lol. Used to be able to find the small flat packs of them in the stores. Now you can't find them anywhere in my town. NOWHERE. I use them for golf club utility ""towels"".  Just pierce a hole and use a shower curtain clip to attach to the bag.  They are nearly indestructible and you don't mind getting them dirty for cleaning the club heads etc on a moist day after the course has been mowed.  When they get really bad, you just throw them out.  The real golf towels are reserved for hands and grips, but these are great for the club faces and shafts.  As others have noted these are hard to find in stores.  Very glad Amazon still sells them. Love these, and so much less expensive to buy in bulk.  I use these over and over again for washing dishes.  Probably can get several weeks use out of one with light use.  They are thinner than a normal dish rag, so they dry faster and are less likely to get mildewy.",1,1

"I love veggie straws but have become hooked on these as well.  They're shaped more like a traditional chip and have a decent flavor without the grease or guilt. It's nice that you can eat them at work without getting crumbs and grease on your hands :-)  In my opinion they don't have as much flavor as veggie straws but that's okay because they're still delicious and healthier than traditional chips.  These 100 calorie packs are perfect to grab in the morning for a snack or part of your lunch.  When I'm wanting a little extra with them, I dip them in hummus and it's delicious. These are yummy!  I liked that the chips were in individually portioned and that I could grab one & go. (or to pack in my lunch) The challenge was that I couldn't open the bag without a pair of scissors.  I don't typically carry scissors with me so this is a fail.  If I have to ""start"" the bag by clipping before I go, I don't consider these portable at all. I love these chips! This package comes with 8 backs of 100 calorie bags of chips and it's a decent portion. This is my go to (along with popcorn) to fufill the crunchy chip craving without going overboard on calories. The shape makes them good for dipping too! I eat them with 1-2 tablespoons of hummus, a triangle of the soft laughing cow cheese, or salsa but they're tasty on their own too. If you wanted to save some money you could probably buy a big bag a a grocery store and portion into little zip lock bags yourself but these are just so quick and easy to grab that I can't help buying them! These are delicious! I wished I could find them at my local grocery store. I appreciate that these come in individual packs to help control my snacking. Very crisp - taste like they shouldn't be healthy. I most definitely would purchase again. Great for packing lunches or eating on the go. Good size You know those packing peanuts you use to get in boxes? Ok, so get one of those, add some color to it, flatten it a little and you have these.  SO not a good taste. No one at all has liked these. I've begged people to take them off of my hands. Perhaps it's just me, but I feel like I bought a big bag of mostly air. I know chips are supposed to ""settle"" after they are packaged, but the little bags inside the bigger bag were half full of only air. There weren't enough crisps inside a single bag to satisfy my appetite and I did think they were somewhat bland. Great snack! Get your veggies and enjoy them! I didn't think I'd like veggie chips of any kind and was genuinely surprised. Great snack for camping, around the house or wherever. Really delicious, I initially bought them for my self created diet plan. It was a nice way to get low calorie snacking. I wouldn't buy it again mostly because I'm out of that snacking phase... but totally worth it at the time.",1,1

"I found the Korkmaz brand after melting 3 of my previous copper bottomed set from leaving on a hot stove with nothing in it.  Stupid of me I know- but I had ruined too many and needed another set.  I first purchased a 6.5 qt casserole (back left in picture- not part of this set).  I used that one daily and wanted more.  Then found this set.  It's a great set.  I love this cookware.  I once again left it empty on high *for an hour* and it did not damage the pot at all.  I don't suggest you test this out, but it is good to know- they are sturdy.  I don't like rivets because food gets stuck in them. The inside of the pans are fully smooth.  Bottom is curved which makes for easy cleaning.  The edge is made so that when your pour something out, it doesn't drip all down the side.  I can't say enough about this cookware!  I cook regularly for a family of 7.  The only ""negative"" thing is I want everything Korkmaz makes.",1,0

"I was only able to use 5 rolls out of all of these. The others did not stick. Or were stuck onto itself and not able to remove.

So cute and festive! wonderful selection for use at school and a great price Perfect I loved the colors and ease of decorating with them.",1,1
"These toys deserve 5 starts because there is no way these can get moldy. That happened to our other bath toys. And these look cute and fun for my baby. I love any bath toy that does not have a way for water to become trapped inside and become a moldy, disgusting mess. These are simple, but have provided so much fun for my little one. He loves watching the water come out of the holes in each toy. He also loves pouring water into the little toy that has the spinning thing. They are also very durable. My son does this thing where he thinks it's hilarious to throw soaking wet bath toys out of the tub... As hard as he can throw them. These toys have been put through the ringer, and they still look brand new. They are also super easy to clean, which is always a plus when it comes to bath toys. I ordered these toys for my son since theres no way these can really grow mildew;they are hard plastic with strainer holes but, these were not worth the price in my opinion. I was reminded of a toy from a happy meal....and its not the fact they are plastic, its just not enough going on for the price. And i dont mean loud noises and lights its just this couldve been cheaper. Also the penguin came with scratches on it out the package. Buy it if you want mildew free toys but, you wont be getting much. P.S. the package says 12 months old and up but i got it for my 6 month old, i cant see a child older than 12 months being into these. These are made of plastic and don't retain water so I bought them because I don't want issues with mold.  They are like little cups with holes on the bottom to release the water. My son is fascinated by the water coming out of the holes and tries to ""catch"" it.  The only downside is he loves to bang these around so it's loud and probably not the best for the tub but I will live with it.  Highly recommend for long lasting bath toys. There are not a lot of super fun bath toys out there, or quality bath toys, for that matter. I liked this one because it was made of substantial material and easy to clean. My daughter tries to drink from the cup but the holes don't allow her, so that's a win. :) The design is cute. Aside from trying to drink from it, she doesn't use it a lot, but then again she is most concerned about trying to jump ship when she is in the tub. My son loves to spill things, which obviously he is not allowed to do in most situations. I bought these penguin buoys so he could have lots of fun spilling water in the tub, and he was so stinking excited about them! He has had them now for over a month, and the joy has not worn off--they are easily his favorite bath toy. As a bonus, I can also use them to rinse shampoo from his hair. I gave this 4 stars because my 5 month old daughter isn't very interested in it. She does like watching the stream of water that trickles down from the strainers..so that's a plus! I waited some time before I rated it because I knew that she wouldn't take to it right away when I bought it  a month ago. I think she might like to play with these outside of the tub; haven't tried it yet because they're too hard for her yet and I want her to be sitting up on her own first. But I would recommend it to other moms because it's safe and I haven't seen any mold growing on it yet, which is a big concern for me! They are cute but don't do much. We love bath time and my daughter needed more toys to play with (aka mom got bored with the few rubber duckies we had). These all have strainer holes in the bottom, and I wish that at least one was a solid cup. I should just give her some Tupperware :) We take the purple penguin to the pool because it floats - there is enough air inside of the head of the you to keep it buoyant.",1,1

"I am 5’9” and wear US size 12 in dresses and bottoms. Size US Large (12-14) in tops. I opted for an XL in this suit because of my height and love it. Jamaica, here I come! This is a beautiful bathing suit. It is unbelievably high quality for the price. The suit actually seems to be a bit of a compression fabric and acts as a smoother - very flattering to the torso. I wear an 18/20 in bathing suits and I purchased the XXXL. It fits like a dream. It is not easy to feel confident in swimwear as a woman of size, but this does the job! The ruffle across the shoulders both hides the upper arm and creates balance with the hips, accentuating the waist line. If you are a pear shaped or hourglass figure, this is going to be flattering on you. The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is that the suit is white background but only lined in the front for some reason. This means it will likely be see-through in the back when wet. I'll keep my sarong on outside of the pool for sure. I am looking forward to wearing this confidently on our cruise next week. I bought the XL on the white. I'm 5'7"" and I'm 170 pounds. This covers everything I need to cover. No visible back fat, no belly showing... I love it! I'm actually going to buy the black one. Wish they had MANY MORE colors... I would buy them all. Looks exactly like the picture. Colors are the same as pictures. Extremely happy with this purchase, surprised it never fell off specially being in the ocean and being tumbled by waves. Must have ❤️ Very nice quality, better than what I expect, I ordered size small, that fit perfect to me. I am very glad I got the right one Quality is great! Size small fits me. I normally wear xs. This bathing suit it too cute. I am very impressed with the quality. I like that I can wear it off shoulder as well. Quick delivery is a plus as well. Very cute bathing suit! I think it's really good quality material for the price. I am 5'9 and wear a size 12 in pants normally. I would've normally ordered a large, but I ordered an extra large per the review of a woman who shares my height and clothing size, and I'm glad I did. The suit fits perfectly. So if you're tall, I'd suggest ordering up. I can't wait to wear this for my trip to California!",1,1
"Boy howdy did I like these! Super-duper snacks right out of the sack, and great added to breakfast oat meal. Was going to re-order immediately and sad to see it's no longer available. I signed up for an alert if it gets restocked through amazon. In the meantime I've ordered other Little Duck flavors expecting these will be just as good. My daughter loves this! We initially purchased this to put in her Little Duck blueberry oatmeal to add more flavor. We would mix a little into the and my daughter loved the taste. When she got older this was a great little snack. The best parts are that it is organic and there are no additives. I feel comfortable letting my daughter eat this whenever she wants. Not nearly as good as other freeze dried fruit snacks for toddlers.  The size is too small and there were pieces with the peel left on.  The flavor is so-so.  Will not repurchase.  I do like that they are organic and only 2 ingredients. I bought these for my 2 yr old which is a picky eater. He loved all of them except the blueberries. I think he didn't even try them cause of the color and round shape. My 17 yr old loved the blueberries so it's my picky eater. I will buy these again. Not as good as the original box we got. These are smaller quantity and not resealable, but the quality appears to be the same. My 15-month-old LOVES these snacks, and I feel good about feeding them to her because they are just fruit. They taste great, too! My daughter LOVES these. She ate two bags in one sitting when we first got them and loves every variety. I love and hate how small the pieces are. I love that I don't have to worry about her choking, but they're not fun to clean up when she spills them on the ground. I would absolutely recommend them to other parents and buy them again. My toddler can’t live without them. I figure there are far worse snacks for her to take interest in. I love them too! They’re organic and delicious.",1,1
"I bought these microfiber towels to detail my cars. They are plush and seem to be made of quality materials. However, the company attached a heavy cloth tag that seems a bit abrasive if rubbed onto the clear coat of the car. They are difficult to remove and cause some damage to the seam where they are attached.  The company has contacted me and sent me another package of microfiber towels with removable tabs.  These are made of the same quality microfiber and they are great.  Well done!!!  I was told to request this type of towels for future purchases.  Thanks again Microfiber Wholesale... We recently got a new dishwasher and it's black stainless steel so my usual cleaning methods weren't going to work this time. I already had one of the expensive microfiber towels that I received from my mother-in-law but I wanted to have more than one and I didn't want to pay a lot of money. There are so many towels to choose from and I chose these because they had the best overall reviews at the time, a great color selection, and were a good price. Ive had microfiber cloths before for cleaning and all, and I never found them to be more outstanding than regular cotton cloths. these are nothing like what I've tried before- they really grab and soak up every oil, dirt, grease, moisture, and any debri on the surface you are cleaning!! I just either use them dry or wet them in water to use.  I drilled holes for cabinet knobs and I used these for wiping the wood debris on the floor and man, they really pick up EVERYTHING.  One problem is that the wood debris are stuck on the microfiber and it's very difficult to get them off because this fanric really holds on to things.  I have better things to do than brag about my kitchen cleaning cloth but I couldn't help with these.  One negative thing is that these dry your hands (fingers especially) very bad since they wick any moisture off of whatever it's touching.  I guess I can wear thin gloves while using these. I ordered these in white. Helps maintain a clean home in a less wasteful fashion than paper towels. We seem to use a lot of paper towels, so trying to cut down on both environmental impact, as well as expenses. These machine wash well. Sometimes I even bleach them with my husband's socks. Skipping fabric softener will help them retain their absorbency power. Our farm house creates plenty of grody cleaning jobs for these towels. The size is generous, & they're very absorbant. I keep one perched atop each of my bottles of antibac, wood, & glass cleaners. I tend to use every surface of one before washing. Perfect for lint free glass cleaning, too! I'm very pleased with my purchase! I'll be ordering the black ones in the same large size soon. No incentive was given for my unbiased review. If you found this helpful, please vote helpful. Any questions will be answered to the best of my ability. Thank you! These things are simply amazing. When you need a soft surface for those more sensitive cleaning projects, these work,perfectly. When you need a super absorbent towel, these things are amazing. I actually wiped my full size truck down after a rain storm, wringing the towel out frequently, one towel did the trick and the truck looked like it had just been washed, windows and all. I use the. For everything from everyday dish towels, to projects like wiping down stainless steel appliances with mineral oil. They do it all. I never bought any microfiber towels because I did not like how my rough hands would catch on the fibers. I thought they were gimmicky until I actually tried one. I immediately went on Amazon to order a pack because I LOVED them! I chose these because of the good reviews. They are not too large and not too small, they are thick and durable. Overall, they are a good value for the price.  I ordered the green and it is a nice color. Why I love these towels so much is because the little knobby microfibers clean dishes as well as a scrubby. I cook alot of eggs and cheese which can be a headache to wash off once dried. Well, with microfiber it only takes a few swipes and my dishes are squeaky clean. I also tried washing windows with them and they came out nice and streak free. Ok, maybe I am late figuring out the wonder of microfiber for cleaning but now I am hooked.",1,1

"Even it's a little expensive, but better design, better quality, compared my  another cheap one from the same seller, it's really value for this money. If budget is enough, choose this one definitely. Received chair very fast and the delivery guys set it up in no time. I had some queries about the adjustable backrest and seller responded very quickly and even sent his men down again to assist. Very impressed and thankful. Product is sturdy and feels expensive. Suits my needs perfectly. First of all I want to thank you for the flawless delivery. The item came within 24 hours. The seller contacted me to arrange for a delivery. Unfortunately I was not home during the time slot but they left it with my security guard, as per my instruction. Excellent condition, all pre assembled. Very comfortable to sit on. Highly recommended for people who are looking for good back support. i bought both the smaller one and this one. I would say although it is double the price, it is much more worth it to get this one. The cushion is more comfortable and so is the meshing. Larger too. Only problem is that it cannot bend as low as the other one. Item is of good quality and includes installation. I opted to install myself only to realise a part of the chair was wrong. Seller was quick to respond to offer a change. Good service.",1,1

"Yes, large capacity. This “can” be carried like a backpack but not in a completely comfortable way.  The backpack strap, which is also the crossbody strap, freely slides through the d-rings making it prone to shifting when putting it on, taking it off, or leaning to the side. Strategic knot tying solves this but then the sleek look of it is ruined. I don’t mind but you might. I got this because the rectangle shape makes the most of the space when used as a carry on, putting it under the seat or in the overhead compartment versus jamming in lumpy duffel bags/backpacks.  The tote arrived with a strong chemical lemon smell to it and it’s been over two weeks and it still has this odor!  I’m debating if I should return it.  I probably would not recommend this. Perfect bag! I really love everything about it. I used it today for travel and it holds plenty. You can carry the bag in your hand, or it fits wonderful on top of your rolling suitcase. Great for the price and good for the quality. Very nice travel bag! It is light and in good quality. Very useful for traveling. Can be adjusted to a backpack too! Will recommend my friends to buy it! Thank you! Love this bag! Used Frontier airlines to travel whom allows a free personal bag on flights. This bag expanded enough for three days worth of clothes, toiletries, a pair of sandals and a purse!! It can be carried as a backpack, a shoulder bag or a tote. You will not regret purchasing this bag!! I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot by air. It has perfect size for iPad and PC. And you can easily get access to your computer with it. Besides, it’s water-proof fabric for any weather conditions. It can help to protect your electric device very well. This bag is awesome. When I open the package I thought for sure it was too small. But the other reviewers were correct, it definitely fits a lot of stuff. The sleeve to go over your suitcase handle is exactly what I was looking for. The front zipper fits your passport and paperwork, etc. I am very happy with my purchase. Haven't used it yet but feels very sturdy and has plenty of room for my needs. I took this bag to Asia as my carry on and it was seriously like a Mary Poppins bag I could not believe what fit in there. Love the suitcase handle sleeve to attach to luggage. The only thing I would change is to have the body portion have a removable padding that allows for structure, unless its completely stuffed full it flops a bit and it would be nice to have that option. Fits perfectly under airplane seat.",1,1
"This action cam is 4K quality and comes with an app. Instructions and notes come with the product. The carry case is a nice touch considering it comes with bindings and accessories to get you started. I think, as far as action cams go, this bundle has a lot of value and over delivers. I like this little camera. It takes acceptable video and stills for the price and comes with some handy accessories. It even comes with two batteries included and a handy waterproof case. Really fun camera to use if you are like me and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a go pro. I recommend this nice little action camera package. Prefect equipment for sport lover. It have so many stuffs. Looks greatly professional and nice. Bought as a gift for my husband. He recorded wearing in the house. The video was great, it has a wide screen and edges are covered, but that is the try of view. He is really happy and plans on using for events he goes to. This camera is amazing and the best value on the internet!! My son has wanted one for a long time and couldn't really see myself spending what other places wanted so to get this great product for a great price is pretty awesome!! Camera take good quality photos and video. Only down fall is if camera is in sun the rear screen starts bouncing around and distorting. Kind of disappointing considering this camera is supposed to be used for recording activitys such as biking, skating and other outdoor activitys in the sun and heat. Love it, I bought 3 for Family comes with tons of features! Works ok but way to hard to work with. The controls for finding and removing pics along with other things is very hard to find.",1,1
"I have a lucidsound ls30 headset and was looking for something to cover up the background noises (not that this is a real major issue with the mic), and these did the trick. The opening on the foam appears small, but just be careful and the foam will fit after a few seconds of wiggling. This is an essential part of the BT-250 noise cancelling function. I see drivers who have lost their foam balls and I feel sorry for their loved ones: it's a miserable conversation without them. I'm happy to tell them I have all they need for $5.00 each. Arrived on time. My Husband is a truck driver and has to use a hands free headset. Needless to say he loses the little foam part often. These worked well and seemed to be of high quality. These windscreens are absolutely great. The do not slip off the Mic boom as others I have tried did.  After testing these windscreens outside it the wind, the person on the other end of the phone did not hear the wind. Improved the sound greatly by reducing breath noise on my Plantronics Audio 655 USB Multimedia Headset with Noise Canceling Microphone for PC and Mac (ASIN B001SEQN3K) This does the trick, I often pace while troubleshooting with customers on my headset. I have several fans set up around my office, so when I moved from room to room, I would get wind sounds in the headset that would affect sound quality. Purchased for truck Bluetooth mic and peltor headset. The foam is the same size as the peltor but it does not stretch. I tore it immediately. The opening will fit a pencil but not much more. These work great.  Got for my Plantronics headset and they reduce the wind noise to basically nothing.",1,1

"Wear these for bike riding all summer.  Super easy to put on / take off.  Very airy and cool on the feet.  Size 3 in kids is equal to size 5 in women's.  I am an adult with small feet so I buy this size.  I have pedaled with these every day about 10 miles daily  all summer.  I love them.  They don't show any wear at all yet.  Just some dirt.  Love them.  Will definitely buy again. I like these shoes they are very lite and have good air flow. They are great for the summer months when going to the lake or water activities. We bought 3 pairs of new shoes for our son recently. 2 from the mall and this one on Amazon.  Every time we went out, he would only pick this one. We compared them and realized this one was the softest. Sometimes he did not wear socks but his feet did not stink. Thanks for the breathable material. Overall it's cheap but good. These shoes caught my eye since my child has to wear closed toed shoes to preschool.  I wanted something light, breathable, and easy to put on.  These shoes fit all the qualifications and are a nice color.  I really like that the soles are more like those for running shoes.  My child really likes them too. These shoes are amazing! My kid spends his summer on the boat and at summer camps and I'm usually packing multiple shoes. Not anymore! And he doesn't look dumb changing shoes out. They look fine with his clothes and he can wear them everywhere. We'll be getting these every year. Fantastic. Which is okay cause my kids will grow into them! I love the color of these! They are so cute! I got them so they could use them for the beach when we go! They are loose fitting so his feet won’t sweat! They are Velcro so easy for toddlers! These are perfect fast shoes for the beach! This shoes are perfect for summer. I bought it for my baby boy. The color blue looks vibrant and non fadable. Even though the shoes are mesh and breathable, you can't see the feets. Have a hook and loop closing and are extremely flexible. If I enjoy flexible shoes, so my baby will. I ordered these shoes for my son because they looked like they would slide on and off for my toddler really well. He is able to put them on by himself. They are breathable and perfect for him to wear when he’s playing outside. They dry quickly and fit him just right.",1,1

"I use the laptop for my brand / web design business - it's great! It's able to handle all my graphic design programs without going slow. I'm terrible about having a gazillion tabs open on my browser and several graphic design programs open at once, plus my email program, this laptop can handle it all just fine. The web cam is nice and screen share/capture programs work nicely on it. So glad I got it - worth the value! This laptop is working out great so far.  Really like how fast it runs and the price was really good.  Don't seem to see any slowness after installing the Meltdown and Spectre patch from Microsoft. Arrived today (2-21-18)....not impressed by how cheap the feel of this laptop is, I can get over that. I plugged in the charger, powered up/configured account information....noticed response time was a bit sluggish but I continued to install email/dropbox and windows updates, walked away from this laptop for a few hours came back and my dropbox was transfering via (LAN @ 1Gb) at 1 Gig per hour, that's nuts (way to slow)...noticed that the hard drive activity was at 100% did the usual stopping of services like windows search, Background Intel and Skype uninstall, but still this 100% hard drive activity won't go away, even after a reboot the computer is sluggish even at the login screen, after a few hours of troubleshooting I decided to reset the OS back to factory and see what that does. As you can see in the picture The only reason the computer did not get 5 stars is because the picture and the description show a dark blue computer, but it is purple. Very good computer at a very good price two problems they're both my fault cuz I didn't really notice.... the first is bright purple like not dark purple or bluish purple but bright purple like a clown color but I got a skin for that ....so the only real technical problem is no key lights it has no keyboard lighting so even in dim light it's very difficult to use. It's a great machine, fast and reliable, would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the battery which doesn't last long, with full charge it will last just 3-4  hours of use, even with 70% brightness. Excellent laptop to use and to navigate The laptop works great, has everything we needed, like Microsoft office pre loaded. Everything came as it should. Love it!",1,1
"Bought these in a women's size 9 and had to send them back cause they were too small.  I wear a sized 8 1/2 to 9 in New Balance so these run a little small.  I reordered a size 9 1/2 and they are perfect.  It's like walking on pillows. So get them a little bigger. I got a pair of nike's on clearance two years ago and they lasted a long time so i knew what brand i wanted to go with when they wore out (to be fair, I do wear them everyday, most tennis shoes don't last more than 6 months with me). these were about twice the price for the exact same shoe but it was worth it. I can really feel the difference between wearing a good pair of running shoes and the cheap offbrand pair I got to tide me over until I got these. They really aid in any back or joint pain I can get. Additionally, I have a wide but short foot so finding shoes that fit my foot isn't easy but these fit perfectly. I only wish the white stripe were black because it'll look dirty quick. I love these shoes. The fit perfect. My feet never went numb when wearing these all day long. Also another huge plus, I never had any blisters from these shoes. These are very comfortable. The only thing that did happen, I ordered a 6 and they sent me 61/2 they are a little big, but nothing to the point where I need to return them. I love the colors. I did have to break in these shoes, as I wear them to work. Break in meaning the bottom of the shoes are very slippery. I work in meat plant where we break down whole carcasses, and the fat gets on the floor. (I know these shoes aren't meant for this kind of environment, but the shoes that are, are not all that comfortable and they don't make them in a wide) So I have to find what is comfortable, and is to my taste in how the shoe looks. So the shoe doesn't have the traction for our floor, but once I broke these in, I now have traction on our floor. I will be buying a second pair, so I can have a pair for going some where nice. These Nikes are so comfortable! Fit exactly as per usual 9.5 does for me. Added some arch support as that fades quickly w all tennies but the cushioning support of the sole is holding up well to the 3 or so times a week gym routine I've put them through! Great orange color, vibrant but not obnoxious! Only complaint is after a couple of months the stuffing in the ribbing around the laces is kinda poking through but I'm sure I'm the only one who notices... Very comfortable but too cushy a footbed.  I know that sounds crazy but I need MORE arch support than cushy foam which my foot rolls around in.  I kept them anyway & inserted a more solid footbed over the cushy footbed.  These are cute sneaks & I recommend them. THE ONLY PROBLEM I AM HAVING WITH THESE SHOES IS THAT THE RIGHT SHOE HAS MATERIAL THAT IS STICKING Really good shoes. I do sport in them and also wear them for just everyday things. Super comfy and they dont make your feet sweaty. Mine fit really well and still fit with thicker or thinner socks. Actually look good they are not cheap, they are really well made. You can clean them in the washing machine without a problem which is so useful. Good product. They are good for what they are but do not expect designer super well made shoes they are just normal sneakers for a great price which is what makes them such a good deal. I am happy with the product over all. I am a lifelong fan of high heals, platforms, and sex kitten shoes...alas, after an injury (nothing to do with my shoes, LOL) my doctor told me no more heals over 1.5 inches...EVER. I was crushed and grieved my shoe collection. After giving away 112 pairs (yep, 112) i set out to find a tennis shoe...after buying and trying many pairs I found the Nike Downshifter....they are comfortable, very cute, and your feet stay cool all day.  I can't believe I'm writing this, but they may be my favorites ever.  I'm horribly sad that Nike stopped making them.  Time to stock up! GRAB A PAIR, OR 10...if you can beat me to them...hahahaha",1,1
"Decent and affordable, works as expected, even has a little hoody. We have a project to help homeless people as the weather gets colder. One of the goals is to provide 100 sleeping bags. So if you see alot of these going to Columbus, Ohio, that's why. The project leader chose these sleeping bags for donors to purchase for Project Hope - to assist area homeless people with food, warmth, personal care items, etc. without judgement or requirements. I'll be buying more as part of my monthly commitment to donate to this important project. In other words: We love these sleeping bags!! Took this on a trip to Colorado - used it at around 9,500 feet.  Daytime was 105 deg nighttime was in the 50's.  Perfect for camping - lightweight and easy to carry.  Only negatives I have:  the ""pillow"" at the top was a little flat - bring your camp pillow, and it is VERY hard to get back into the little bag - but that is typical of any sleeping bag - they grow. When it arrived, my sleeping bags looked too big which I was disappointed , but I didn't realize I could pull the straps to make the bag smaller Wich it helps, because it reduces almost 50% of the size when it arrived. I used these for a sleepover at an aquarium and in my case it takes time for me to wake my body and this time I didn't feel cold, I put one on top of my air mattress and the other one used as a blanket. Bought one to check it out, our last sleeping bags weren't warm enough.  My son went camping with his class and the nights were cool, especially near the water.  I was afraid that he'd be cold but he told me that he was toasty warm, so much so on one night he unzipped the bag! Hard to believe considering how lightweight they feel. I just bought another for my other son and buying a third for my daughter for summer camp! Highly recommend! We went camping this past Saturday, it was a beautiful day and when night came we were ready for bed. That night was extremely cold, I believe it was 30 degrees we were literally freezing our butts. I grab the sleeping bag not expecting to make any difference but they kept us warm through the night. The sleeping bags are extremely warm, pretty good size and the material was not to heavy. We had to replace our sleeping bags and decided to try these out. I highly recommend them! I stayed warm at night but never got too warm. I love how lightweight they are and you can easily roll them up and put them in the bag. I bought this sleeping bag to take on a weekend backpacking trip on the AT. This was over labor day weekend, so I really wasn't planning on needing a warm sleeping bag, but this one was well rested and light weight. As fate would have it, the remnants of hurricane Harvey came through the area for two nights of our trip. We were near the top of Mount Rogers the second night and there temperatures fell dramatically, and everything was soaking wet. Winds picked up and were gusting hard all night. I was sleeping in a hammock with a bug net and a rain fly. This bag actually kept me very warm and comfortable and dry. My brother had purchased a lighter bag for warm weather and was miserable getting little to no sleep. I would recommend this bag for any spring through fall camping trip.",1,1
"These are now my default casual shoes. Super light and so comfortable, I forget I’m wearing them. I have two colors and wear them around the house everyday...especially nice after wearing heels for work. The means given for measuring your foot and then determining what size to order was way off. I normally wear a size 8 1/2 US but because of the instructions ordered a 9 1/2. Turns out the 8 1/2 would have been right. Not bad.  VERY light weight sneakers - which I love - sort of wide and slips off my feet every now and again.  I usually wear a 10 US.  I bought a pair for me and my sister which wears 8.5  When opened, they had a VERY STRONG odor - not good - but they aired out pretty quick. Great shoe for the price. Lacks arch support completely but for the price, it's good quality. These shoes fit perfectly.  They are really comfortable and they are super cute.  Super lightweight. The price was very reasonable and I purchased multiple pairs.  Whether I spend a great deal of money (hundreds) or I spend a minimal amount of money, I walk through and rotate my walking shoes. These shoes are great in my rotation.  The only thing I would change is to make the cushion a little thicker Love these shoes, comfortable, lightweight & nice looking...have had a couple inquire s as to where are got them already. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was it took 6 weeks to get here...likely because they were red...not many people want that color so not in stock...anyway worth the wait! LOVE these shoes!  They fit perfect, I usually wear a 7 1/2 - that is what I bought, and they they are perfect!  They have quite a few colors in them, so think I will be getting more. Nice to have around the house, for quick shoes to grab to run outside or to the store. Don't need socks, cause they are comfy to wear around with out them. I can think of dozens of reasons to wear them. I purchased these shoes for my 28 yr old daughter. They looked great on her-with dress, shorts, work-out wear. She loved them said they were super comfy...so I got myself a pair-i usu wear 8, but only 8 1/2 avail -they fit great. I wear orthotic inserts as there is not much of an arch, but they have a sturdy sole & i love them & am going to order another pair for future-good $ !!",1,1

"The Acer Predator G9-793-79V5 is probably the best choice I made for a gaming laptop, I really was tempted to get an Asus ROG but after checking the specs between them I believe this one convinced me. Will try to be as detailed as possible. This laptop is absolutely amazing, everything came in perfect. I am always worried about getting a lemon when buying a gaming laptop, and all the reviews out there. Fantastic laptop. I used an Asus G73 for about 6 years and finally replaced it with the Acer Predator 17 based on my extensive research. Every gaming laptop has some issue that people do not like. This laptop has the ""locked bios issue"" which doesn't really bother me as I may not ever need to upgrade the SSD's. This laptop runs ALL the latest games in the highest settings with no problems. I almost never hear the fans kick on to full. But just a warning, when the fans are on full, you better be using headphones! The frostcore doesn't seen to help too much but as i generally have no need for a DVD, I just leave the frostcore in (the frostcore is included with the laptop). I have only had the laptop for about a month now but so far it has been great and I am extremely happy with this machine, I did NOT receive any discount on this machine for my review. I hope it helps people doing research like when I did. First off, I want to say that I am incredibly happy with my purchase. After doing a lot of research on laptops with great build quality, specs, and price, I settled on the Acer Predator 17. The amount of sheer horsepower this laptop has is simply incredible. You can easily run any game on max settings with 70+ FPS. I'm really enjoying playing Fortnite, Dark Souls 3, Overwatch, and Witcher 3 on maximum graphics and buttery smooth framerates. With my opening remarks out of the way, let me get started on the details!",1,1
"First, if you are using  I love this kit - everything I need to sketch great drawings in one durable carrier.  Super-duper happy with this purchase. This set is great. I love the case, that is the #1 reason I bought it frankly. I took the pencils that came with it out and replaced them with my Tombow pencils. The ones in the set aren't bad, just not what I prefer. I replaced both sharpeners with my own better quality ones, and have been very happy overall. Totally recommended. Wowzers!!  Got this thru Amazon Warehouse Deals (not sure if it was a return or what but it was BRAND NEW) and am thoroughly impressed!  Never sketched before and am learning thanks to this awesome set.  Couldn't ask for anything more!  WoW!!  Zip case is nice but the pop up option was the main reason I got this particular set. I really like that added feature!!!  Two HUGE thumbs UP! I love this set.  It is so organized I will know if any of my kids have been getting into it without permission! Everything is great quality, the variety of everything is helpful to have at my finger tips, and did I mention - it's ORGANIZED?  Love it. This is the best pencil set I've ever owned!!! I've been drawing since i was in grade school and know a thing or two about graphite and charcoal pencils. Everything you need is inside of the well contained case. I love it. Recommended! We bought two of these sets of art supplies, one for each of our granddaughters.  They both are very good artists and loved what they got.  I would recommend this for anyone who is serious about doing art work and wants the best set of tools.  It makes a great gift. Not only does my family love this product, they are warrantied. They loved the pencils and the case they came i.  My nephew, a fabulous artist, was so thrilled to receive these for Christmas.  Then, shortly after,  his family's house burned down. The seller was so kind to replace this wonderful supply of drawing pencils when they found out about the tragedy.  Thank you so much for a wonderful product and such a kind gesture to replace them.",1,1
"I recently purchased this in November 2016 with the soul purpose of integrating my new Amazon Echo with it to voice control my house.  My current set includes: Amazon echo in the kitchen, an Amazon dot in the playroom, an Amazon dot in our master bedroom, approaching 30 different GE Zwave and Zwave+ light switches/dimmers and add on switches (more on that later) and 3 HUE colored light bulbs (more on that later, as well). I bought this system to act as security system in my home.  Also wanted some lighting and outlet automation.  This kit has a ton of potential but I keep running into problems and very frustrated with system.",-1,-1
"True to the name!! It is STERLING SILVER!! Glad to finally order a ring online that isn't a lie! Love this, I wear it everyday. Matches my tattoo (: definitely recommend and will be a continued customer. Very cute ring but the sun's rays are less defined in person than in the picture and more like a wavy circle around the sun's face. My other complaint is that it is smaller than a normal size 5 ring, probably more like a 4.5 or maybe 4.75, just not quite a true size 5. It still fit on my finger, just a bit snug and I can't take it off. I'm going to try wearing it to see if it is comfortable enough top get used to. This lovely ring is even more beautiful in person than it is in the picture. It's strong enough to withstand the activity & housework that I do, but delicate and shaped well to add grace to my hand.  I love it! I was really excited to get this ring, Sadly, when it arrived today it is a horrible black grey color. 100% tarnished and not ever wearable. Save your money. You can get a better ring in a gumball machine. Love it! The band was thinner than I expected, but I love how dainty it is. It definitely WILL NOT turn your finger green as it is 100% sterling silver. There is an inscription on all sterling silver jewelry authenticating the grade of the metal, and there is a .925 inscription on the ring. And it was only $10! Can't say enough good things about it though, so happy with this purchase!! Love love love this ring. I ordered it and got it two days later, I was very surprised. I have only had it for about four days now, however I am a waitress and wash my hands a lot. Doesnt leave any color on your skin nor has it started to tarnish. Anyways, if you're considering it, BUY IT. I love everything about this ring. One of my hobbies is looking at the sun light and watching the beautiful moon. Thank you! Sincerely, Linetz Ortiz-Perez  September 22 2016 My mom almost cried when I got this for her on Christmas. Fits perfect and it's the sun and moon which my parents always drew together as a symbol of their love. Cute, well made ring.",1,1

"These are solid business class laptops for a fair price.  I have purchased a number of G3 and a few new G4 laptops and they never disappoint.  If the price is close I suggest the i7 version, but the i5 G4 performs just fine for all but the most intense applications. I’m returning it only because of its size and weight,it’s just too big and heavy for me.",1,1
"When i received my item, the cap was broken and it wasnt able to spray properly at all. Very disappointed I ordered the items in the morning, by evening it was picked up courier and received the items the next day. Super  Impressive  Item is value worth with the given discount. Delivery was smooth, fast and efficient. reasonable price, easy to use",1,1
"Delivery was fast, company was instantly responsive, and set-up was very simple and quick (100% assembled in less than 10 minutes).  Most importantly, it's a great product!  I've been vermicomposting for many years and this is the best worm bin/bag that I've used (comparing to the Worm Inn, Worm Factory 360, and oodles of DIY Rubbermaid totes).  It's simple enough for beginners; the breathable mesh sides all but eliminate the problem of over-wetness, which is what dooms many first-timers. I have used a Worm Inn for years, and despite getting good production out of it, I always thought it required too much ""maintenance"" - i.e., constantly having to flush water to keep it moist, adding a barrier (garbage bag) over the top to reduce evaporation, etc.  The Urban Worm Bag does a much better job of retaining just-enough-but-not-too-much moisture so it doesn't need all that extra attention.  I haven't harvested from it yet, but the zipper mechanism at the bottom seems like a vast improvement over the Worm Inn too. Very excited to get more experience with this product and strongly recommend that you give it a try too! I am absolutely in love with this product. First impression: Very attractive packaging and the assembly was very easy, taking me less than 10-15 minutes. I filled with bedding first and then a few days later, I put about 2 lbs of worms in the Urban Worm Bag and they appear to be doing very well so far. The Urban Worm Bag arrived about two weeks ago and so far I'm loving it! The box was awesome (I still can't throw it out!), and the instructions were super simple and easy to follow. It's a really attractive design and one heck of a conversation starter! This is the second Urban Worm Bag I have purchased. I am really impressed with how much surface area this bag has. I was hesitant at first about the zippers, but they are easy to zip and unzip, and there is a lifetime guarantee on them, so you can’t go wrong.  I like the sturdy metal frame and sturdy connectors. And I put it together in less than 10 minutes. It is that easy. Very responsive seller, too. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a sturdy, well-made product. It's exactly as advertised. I've had the bag a week now. There have been no attempted jail breaks from the worms, so they must like the environment. Today I decided to take a temp and humidity reading inside and outside the bag. In my home it's around 15% humidity and 69 degrees. Normal for Las Vegas. Inside the bag it was 71 degrees and 67% humidity! Unlike most worm-farmers, dryness was my biggest worry, so I think your bag works great for me in our arid climate. I've finally located my Las Vegas worm guy, so I may see if I can't do it outdoors since his worms can definitely take the heat! Compared to other similar designs, this is overall superior. It’s extremely sturdy and feels well made. I think some design changes would make this even better but overall it works very well.",1,1
"My job doesn't require me to dress to the hilt, but I do like to look nice when I'm running around. These fit the bill perfectly. No flashy sparkles or weird color combinations to clash with outfits. I wear a 7-1/2 and that's what I ordered. The shoes fit perfectly. Very soft and cushy. However, there is minimal arch support, so for long periods of standing these wouldn't be the best. I've worn them with and without socks, and never had any rubbing, or black dye coming off. I could not believe the quality of the shoe upon first inspection! I got them in white (which is really white) and feel they are true to size. After wearing them for a couple of days consecutively I noticed the bottom bits we're a bit worn nothing major and I feel if you aren't running in the same pair ever day on concrete they will last if you are I would say pick them up if u need a pair of runners for about 2 seasons. I gave this sneaker 5 stars because I really think it's a great buy for the price! I'm actually planning on buying a second pair! These fit as expected IF YOU READ THE SIZING CHART!  I did not on my first order and ordered the size my daughter was in for a different brand of sneakers.  Big mistake as I had to send back and get TWO whole sizes up.  ...which prompted me to actually measure her foot and go from there.  Once measured, the size I ordered fit like a charm. These are literally like walking on a cloud. I purchased these and a pair of adidas and I’m returning the adidas because these are so comfortable! I typically wear a size 8-8.5 and ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfect! These are so comfortable, I can’t believe they are so cheap!! Order some!! These are the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I’ve ever worn. I usually wear orthodics, but have not with these and have had no issues. The number of compliments I’ve received while wearing them makes me take a shoe off to show others who are shocked at how light they are!  I will be purchasing every color that’s available in my size! Super comfortable and cute sneakers!  Perfect for working out in.  I am not sure I would go for a run in these but I did 30 minutes on the elliptical and then a full upper body work out and my feet look cute and feel great.  I will for sure buy these again and may just get them in every color. You get what you pay for and this is no exception. for what I paid for they are extremely comfortable and fit true to size. I enjoy them for my only gym activity of elliptical. I would not suggest for higher impact activities because I feel as though they would not hold up to it. These shoes are perfect. They are very comfy to walk in and to stand long periods of time in. However, they are not true to size if you're a person who likes to wear socks with their shoes. These shoes are true to size if I don't wear any socks, but I don't like not being able to wear socks. When I wear socks with these shoes, it's a bit tight but it's not too tight where it hurts your feet. If you're a person who likes to wear socks with their shoes, then I recommend buying 1/2 a size or 1 size bigger.",1,1
"The product itself is good. But the Amazon package is horrible! All 6 packs of formula were packed in a transparent plastic bag. The package arrived dirty and damaged. Some seal on the powder box was damaged. I am not sure if it is safe for my 18 months old to drink it anymore. My toddler loves this drink! I tried it and I wasn't impressed, but she loves it! It is definitely not sweet tasting. Honestly I wanted to gag after tasting it! But she Drive is a bottle before bed every night and has for months. After we quit breastfeeding at 13 months, she still woke up hungry and wanting to be fed at 2am when we gave her whole milk before bed. We switched to this toddler formula at night because it is lactose free and she sleeps for 12 hours every night! Amazon has the best pricing I have found, especially if you order it on subscribe and save like I do. You basically get 1 can free for every 5 cans you buy! I recommend this toddler formulae to everyone! It's great! great deal for toddler formula I bought so many times, that is very good for baby Great affordable product with great price. My baby refuses to take anything but this formula!!! I am really pleased. she is doing great and has no tummy issues! Cans arrived damaged I always prefer Non-GMO.",1,1
"I’m usually a 10 wide and these shoes are only medium fit. It did gave me a size fit test and the size guide suggested for me to try a 10 1/2. I risk it and the delivery came very quickly. I tried them on as soon as it came. It doesn’t fit too tight, it would if I kept them a size 10. It fits perfect for me. I desperately need workout shoes. My old ones were wearing out! After just 1 day and I loved them!  I got them for a great price.  1st Under Armour shoes I have had and I hope they last.  After I received them I thought that maybe there was a little too much white on the sole but I wore them and by the end of the day I just loved the look and feel.  They look better in person than the picture! I bought a pair of these on vacation when my old shoes failed catastrophically and liked them so much I bought another pair when I returned.  My foot is a little wide and I have a high instep, and these shoes are very comfortable.  Walking and hiking many miles over all sorts of terrain in northern Europe convinced me these were some good shoes! While these shoes are great; very light and comfortable, they do run very narrow. I have small feet and usually have an issue in having way too much shoe lace to tie. Not with these, there is a small gap between the side of the shoe and the tongue. Other than that I do like them. I liked these shoes so much I purchased two pair for myself and a pair for my mom. They are cute, lightweight and super breathable. One pair I use for work, I combine them with compression socks during my 12-hour shifts as a floor nurse. My feet aren't tired at the end of the night and my feet never get sweaty. I do think these fit best for those with narrower feet. Love  under armor shoes (have 7 pair) but these do not have good support for a narrow foot. I gave them to my son and he likes them. These shoes do run on the tighter side. I ordered 1/2 size larger than I normally would. Good arch and foot support. I work all day in a clinic, so I look for shoes that are comfortable and supportive. I usually keep my loyalty to Nike but wanted to try something different, I’m glad I brached out. These shoes are cute but don't have good support.  In addition, the tongue is too narrow so you can see part of the top of the foot.",1,1
"Brought an item that someone brought before and then return it. It have something sticky like candy on back of the shirt and one of the threads in the back of the suit was popped They work well and lasted Really loved it! It fit right, and look great, but I purchased a chacroal one, and received a brack one, that's wasn't funny :( Fit like a glove. Very classy!! Great service. Too smal and over all... aweful! Very nice and sharp looking suit. This suit is good quality for the price point, ultimately making it a sound value.  The shiny blazer lapel adds a touch of formality with style.  Unfortunately, the jacket was just a tad small; to wear it, I needed to put both arms in behind my back simultaneously before thrusting/flipping it over my shoulders.  I could have lived with it long term BUT the pant legs were too narrow for my taste.  I felt like my legs were in Chinese handcuffs.  If skinny pants is your swag, don't hesitate in getting this suit - especially for the great price! This package arrived quickly, although the suit was too small, we opted to purchase a suit at a local store.",1,1

"DO NOT BUY .... This does not work with the iPhone 8 Happy with product I threw it out after getting too many ""Accessory not supported"" issues. Its perfect. Apple charges you 19 bucks for the adapter which is only for 3.5mm audio jack but this adapter can take both audio jack as well as the charger. I am verry happy with the product. It charges as fast as the charged connected directly to iphone. I have tried to used these before on my iphone but they used to say “device not supported” and i wouldnot be able to use any adapter, but these works perfectly. I have already spend 2 days with these listening music and charging at the same time, and iphone supperts this device. Very happy with this. This is great for letting me use my earphones and charge my iPhone 7 at the same time. I hate the way they changed the port, so this was a must for me! Wish I didn't need this. Apple continues to make changing products very frustrating with the extra items you need. Bought this product after having to upgrade to an IPhone 7. I bought it because my car is not equipped with blue tooth. I thought the headphone port would also work as an AUX adapter. It does not.",1,1

In the picture it looks like it's kind of a sandblasted look but really it looks as thought it is coated in a really fine glitter dust. It's so bright and sparkly and fits perfectly. I have no problems trying to spin it either.It's like having a fidget spinner on your finger. I HIGHLY recommend this, the pictures don't do it justice, it's so much more beautiful than shown. Thank you for making something so gorgeous. I love this ring. It arrived on time (I was a little worried that it doesn't ship in a box, but no harm came to it), and I've had it on non-stop since then. I've had this ring for about 2 weeks now and just had to write a review. I've had the nervous/bored habit of picking at my fingers since I was a kid. I can't remember the last time I've not had at least one nail bed torn up and bloody. For people with similar habits, I can't recommend this ring enough. It's a great, nondistracting way to redirect fidgety behaviors. I've worn it every day since receiving it and for the first time in years I have intact nail beds! Every time I catch myself starting to pick at a dry patch of skin or uneven cuticle on my finger, I rotate the ring a few times and the impulse disappears. I was so excited for this ring and I double checked my ring size numerous times before ordering. Reviews kept saying that the ring runs small so to order up. I decided to stick with the 10 that I was measuring at and follow the size chart. Ring came today and it's WAY too big. It slides right off my index finger and doesn't even fit on my thumb (which theoretically should be a larger size). I measured my index finger again, and although the measurement is slightly lower than it was when I ordered the ring, it still measures right around a 10 according to the chart. I'm assuming I need a 9. I'm going to try wearing it throughout the day to see if there is any change in swelling of my fingers. Disappointed I'm probably going to have to return this since it's so loose. I've had this ring for over six months and it's still going strong. I wear it in the shower, swimming pool, and at night and it still looks as good as new. The spinning portion dose get gunked up depending on what kind of hand soap I use, but all I need to do is give it a good wash in dish soap with hot water and its as good as new. It helps to keep me from picking on my cuticles and to help me concentrate while I'm studying. All in all, I am very satisfied with this ring and would recommend it to anyone looking for a spinner ring.",1,1

"I was skeptical that this would really affect color at all, since the product description doesn't really describe how it works, but I have very coarse hair and find that conditioner for color-treated hair usually makes it softer, which was reason enough to try it out. This shampoo and conditioner makes it silkier than it's ever been, and I noticed warmer color after three shampoos (on natural brunette hair; FWIW, I left the shampoo in for about ten minutes). Since then, the color is much more noticeable. It's even shiny for once. Love this shampoo!  Keeps the brassiness away from my color.  Extends the life of my color.  Smells great, rinses clean, and leaves my hair feeling and looking amazing!  I do recommend that you make sure you rinse your shower when using so that it does not leave stains!  I highly recommend this TIGI Fashionista Shampoo & Conditioner! I couldn't believe the price point for these when I purchased them!! I went ahead and bought two sets and I am VERY happy with both the shampoo and conditioner! The shampoo is a very rich brown shimmery color and the conditioner hydrates my hair quite well and they both smell so good!!! They're very close to a vanilla type smell but even better. I will purchase this again and highly recommend them to others!! Love this stuff. It keeps my hair vibrant, soft and shiny. I have gotten many compliments on how healthy my hair looks. It definitely adds color. It helps me from having to dye my hair as often. I have a couple strands of gray in my hair and with this stuff, I cannot tell. it turns them a warmer shade and it almost looks like I have natural dark blonde highlights or something. Would buy again. It's ok.  The color is very odd - almost like poo color!  Luckily the smell is nice!  However, it doesn't have the same richness that other Tigi Catwalk shampoos have.  For the price, I guess it is ok - - but I don't think I'll be getting it again. Fast shipping. Bottles came shrink wrapped, then wrapped in bubble wrap and boxed up. No damage to the bottles. Shampoo & conditioner are great at keeping my grey hairs at bay between coloring's, they smell wonderful and make my hair extremely soft and manageable. No more tangles. Love this product my hair is softer, I use serums and it doesn’t feel heavy and sticky some shampoos don’t mix well with hair products but this one does , hair is fresh after shower, smells like chocolate, and I will continue ordering!! It really does dry your hair out. I've used it 4 times & my hair went from soft to straw. I wished I could return it & get my usual bed head antidote resurrection level 3. Oh well lesson learned. If you are like me please read the reviews & make note o how many people have dry hair now.",1,1
"I love these shoes! We got the smaller size when my son was 9 months and after he grew out of them we purchased the 18-24 months size. They are so easy to put on and take off and they are very durable for our very active child. I would definitely recommend these to any parent who is searching for great walking shoes. The reviews that said these are big were not kidding. My son is 10 months and has huge feet. He wears size 4 shoes and his feet are super chunky. In fact, all of him is super big and chunky- he's the height and weight of the average 2 year old. So when I saw these shoes and the reviews and the sizing recommendations I decided to go with the 12-18 month size. That's a size smaller than I would have ordered in another kind of shoe. Well, they are still huge. Like they won't even stay on his feet and there is about 3/4 of an inch at the end. They are super cute, though, and wide so they should work well for his chunky feet- in another 6 months. I decided to keep the pair I have and order the 6-12 month size. Hopefully they fit better. If they don't fit I will update my review, if I don't update then you'll know that a size 6-12 months fits like a size 4. Bought for my 10 month old who is starting to walk and I love these because they have the rubber bottom so he won't slip and also can walk outside with them. Also liked the fact that they are not heavy. The shoes are nice but very big. My son is 14 months old and has longer feet. I bought size 12-18 months and the shoes I got are way too big. I think they would fit closer to a 2 year old. I will keep them for when he gets older, but they really need to change sizes. Definitely get a size smaller. I like that these open widely at the tounge so I can get my son's foot in the shoe easily. The canvas and sole are sturdy. I like that the sole curls around the top of the toe so he can gain traction while crawling and moving from a seated position to standing. So easy to get on and off squirming little feet and the Velcro holds wonderfully. Very satisfied! These shoes worked great....for about 3 weeks. I put them on my child one day and one shoe kept falling off. I realized the velcro failed and was not keeping the shoe on. Shoes were worn almost everyday, however did not even last a month. I guess you get what you pay for..... huge, but thats fine. put away and toddler will wear them later.",1,1
"Most of these belts I have encounter so far are nice enough but leave a bit to be desired when you actually try to pair it with an outfit. This one actually seems to get it right.I should get another couple of colors. This belt is fantastic。  It is line with six abdominal muscles.  High quality genuine leather belt.  Make me more ambitious. It just made it for me A super belt.  Very strong and looks professional when worn either for dress or sporting wear. Excellent quality and solid leather. Other ""leather"" belts have had the primary cover flake off due to the fact it was not solid leather. This Hippih's mens's belt is solid leather and should last some time. Great belt! This classic belt is easy to use and  high quality. Before I bought it I had compared it with the one which I saw in Costco. This classic belt's price is better and the quality is higher. Highly recommend! Super nice belt. It was delivered as promised and packaged beautifully.Very well made! Belt is comfortable and easy to use and feels quite durable. I would highly recommend it! Nice belt fits as promised looks good and does the job I also like the fact that it is ample holes to adjust the size that is one of my pet peeve on many belts but this 1 does the track in can be adjusted very easily would buy it again I'm recently bought this belt to replace my old one, it looks good,nice design and it can tell the quality are good,worthy purchase.",1,1
"I'm kind of a coinnoisseur when it comes to Korean seasoned seaweed, and being far away from home at the moment, I ordered these with a lot of doubts. Turns out, I think they're 'okay'. I personally enjoy wrapping white rice with a sheet of seaweed to make ""Choongmoo""-style gimbap served with kimchi, for which the crispness of the seaweed, quality of pasted oil, and amount of salt seasoning make all the difference. Below are how I rated each quality of this brand... I purchase three brands at once to compare - these (Myungga Premium Roasted), Kim's Premium In Sea Salt, and Wickedly Prime in Maui Onion. These were my favorite of the bunch. I loved them! There is a little bit of oil that could leave residue on things from your fingers if you're not careful, but the oil adds a delicious flavor to the snacks that I looked forward to. Plus, it countered the dryness of the sheets nicely. The Kim's were my second favorite - good flavor and not too dry, but I did miss the oil. The Wicked were a little dry and they had a slight sweetness in the flavor which wasn't bad, but I prefer just the salty alone. My daughter is 11 year old seaweed connoisseur and tried these in place of her usual. She loves them! She likes that they are lightly seasoned and a little thicker than other brands while remaining crunchy. These don't seem to have as much flavor compared to the Wang brand seaweed snacks, but on the other hand they only have 30 grams of sodium per serving compared to the Wang brand 80 grams per serving. I've tried a bunch of seaweed snacks and this is my least favorite. The sheets are about 20% smaller than most other brands and they are less seasoned they taste more like a simple sheet of seaweed and the fishy sea taste comes through more strongly in these than others. A lot better than the more expensive kind. Roasted just right to remove any fishy taste. Best snack ever LOVE seaweed snacks. And for the price, I was PLEASANTLY surprised! Only downfall is that they are a bit greasy, but the flavor makes up for it. There are 10 sheets per package and were crispy, (although I read others’ reviews before buying and theirs said they were not). I used to buy these at the dollar store but I’m buying these from now on!",1,1

"I'm allergic to mint (yes that's a thing lol. I would break out in a rash around my mouth) so I have to use kids toothpaste. I've always used Tom's. Once I discovered my allergy I switched to the strawberry flavor. This is great because it doesn't have the sickening sweet flavor that regular toothpaste has. When switching from ""regular"" toothpaste it may take awhile just because it doesn't have all the sugar and sweetness that you are used to. However it's so much better for you, your teeth and the environment!! Great toothpaste. I use a rice size amount based on the American Dental Association’s recommendations for my five month old. The ADA also recommends using a fluoride toothpaste, but it was hard finding a children’s toothpaste with fluoride.  This fit the bill. I also appreciate the transparency of their ingredients. My son has been using Toms of Maine toothpaste his whole life.  Now, like me, he finds ""regular"" toothpaste disgustingly sweet.  He's 15 now but hasn't outgrown the strawberry flavor.  I don't know why it should be considered a ""kid"" flavor...if you like strawberry, go ahead and use this, whether you are 9 or 99! Personally, I prefer the Clove and Cinnamon flavor, which tastes like apple pie...everyone has their own tastes, so get whichever works for you. This product could literally save civilization. All of my kids hate it. 9 year old, 6 year old and 3 year olds. The 3 year old girls were crying. I guess I will be using it up. I don't like it either. Might be just whatever you are used to. Kids are used to the normal flavor of kids toothpaste and I'm used to mint. Teeth do not feel clean after using. This is a fantastic option for our younger kids who swallow everything. It's safe, effective, and the taste is good. It's not going to suds up like adult toothpaste, so be mindful of that. Personally, as a treat, along with the Sonic Care app with Sparkles (a MUST HAVE with our without the child Sonic care) I'll add a little bubble gum flavor to add in some fun. Tom's is great, the Sonic care child brush is amazing, and the app is even better. Thumbs up all the way around. I use this as my toothpaste as well as my sons toothpaste. Great strawberry taste a major change from all that minty stuff I really cant stand. I just rinse with a fluoridated mouthrinse as well instead of the other non-fluoridated one. My son is one and he isn't a big fan of the popular bubble gum flavors they have mainly for kids, he fought with me and the toothbrush when I used the crest bubble gum flavor but I like that this natural, minimum ingredients, and still gets the job done with out the fight because he loves the flavor. I only smear it like on the corner of his brush since it is fluoridated and he is very young but has alot of his teeth already and plus our water is also fluoridated. But even that little smear gets a smile on his face and he is actually eager to do some brushing of his own!! We used the strawberry which my girls loved.  When I went to buy more I saw that the strawberry was unreasonably priced but the Mango was well priced on Amazon.  Should have known the price reflected its general popularity.  My daughters absolutely hate the taste and complain every time they brush. Now we just have to wait it out until it's done.",1,1

"These vests + a suit were dressy enough for a wedding party and a lot cheaper! Highly recommend. Do iron and/or steam before the day of, the fold lines take a bit to get out. I ordered this for my husband as part of his Halloween costume.  It fits perfect, the size chart is right on.  We don't have to take it in or fix it in anyway.  It fits perfect, and looks amazing. The color is a very pretty purple, and  looks especially awesome with a black shirt under.  I will order more colors in the future! Fast shipping and amazing quality. Thank you I bought and wore this specifically for a close friend's wedding, and it looked so good with my tuxedo.  I am so looking for another occasion to wear it again. when I looking for a little something different for my fourth child's wedding we saw this and it fit the bill. I try to change the look of my tux, either a bow tie and cumberbunn , regular tie and vest or bowtie and vest, I was running out of options until I found this. I was very pleased when it arrived as it was completely as described. I am an extra large shirt (17x34) and the extra large size was perfect The vest fits perfectly. I got an XL and I wear a 44R suit. The ascot tie however, does not fit, even on my bare neck. It's sized for a 15"" or smaller neck. So common sense dictates that someone wearing XL would have a 17"" or larger neck. The cuffs & pocket square are decent quality. It matches everything else. Great product my groomsmen wore for my wedding. the subtle pattern was quite nice with their darker grey suits. It was a little snug but not uncomfortably so.  I was disappointed that the pockets were fake, but it looked good for the price.  The tie was unusable as it was too small. thank you so much. was alittle disapointed that had no place to put the handkerchief.but everything was good",1,1

"I loved the earrings! I was afraid that they were going to turn my ears green but they haven't. I've gone in the shower with them and slept with them on and they have yet to bother me. They are super shiny and the pictures don't do them justice. Definitely worth the buy. The earrings are as pictured. They are pretty, and I can tolerate the stainless steel well. Overall, these were a great buy. They are very nice not to small and not huge do to I have small ear I would order again great for the second piercing on my ear I got them for my girlfriend and she wears all of them. It is a good set because they are very simple and not to flashy. I would not recommend sleeping or showering with them, but overall my girlfriend loves how she can pick a pair to go with an outfit of her choice! I really liked these great price, and fast shipping. would order from again Just as I thought I would get for the price. Earrings are earrings.  I got these to give to school aged children as a back to school gift.",1,1

"GREAT-Amazon did not like my detailed review. Weight of pot is 55 oz and lid is 15 oz. giving total of about 70 oz. Pot height is 5 inches and lid alone is 2.5"" but lid and pot together is 7 inches since lid sinks down into pot.about 1/2 inch. Nice sturdy weight in my opinion. I got this to replace a calphalon pot I ruined that had a very similar look. The calphalon pots are way nicer. This one has a cheap look to the copper layer. Seems to be an okay weight. Sturdy and a nice weight, the pot is attractive for the money. Have only used it twice but functions evenly and cleans easily. Nice weight , cooks great , as advertised Nice pot!

"Delicious and nutritious!  I absolutely love the texture and flavor.  Easy to remove the hull, but I actually prefer eating them with the hull, as it adds a nice chew without being unpleasantly fibrous.  All of the flavors are excellent, and they are extremely satisfying.  One serving at a time fills me up nicely, which is a nice plus for a healthy snack. These are a great low carb, fat, and calorie snack. I eat them as a mid-day snack and I feel satiated until dinner time. I *really* wanted to like these. All of the stats looked good and I was psyched to find a new healthy snack I could rely on, but the taste is somewhere between ""neutral"" and ""moderately unpleasant."" The consistency is a bit slimey, as well. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, and they're meant to be combined with other foods or prepared in some way, but as-is, these beans didn't do it for me. Great lupini beans.... I sampled one pack while in LA and I couldn't find these in any stores by me so I purchased this bundle and love the different flavors. I wish it were a bit less expensive but still a good, healthy, and delicious snack My new favorite snack! I tried a sample of these in a monthly snack box, and became addicted after the first bite! Love all 4 flavors and so thankful that Amazon has an amazing deal with 2 day shipping! These are a great way to stay full and lose weight.  A great product. Great multi-pack and allows you to try the whole line! I think my favorite are the Garlic & Herb and Sea Salt! mmmm...yum! I really like these beans. Will definitely buy more. I put them in chopped salad, where they add a robust note. I like the plain original ones best, but the flavors are good too. Not quite ready to process the dried beans - sounds quite time-consuming - so I'll go with Brami again.",1,1
"The Dell Optiplex line of computers is a high-quality product, and these refurbished units are excellent. They perform exactly as intended, run quietly, and are extremely reliable. I would not recommend this model for ""hard-core gamers"", but for most typical computer work this is a great deal. So far, computer works very well.  No problems with loading on various programs.  Speed seems as advertised.  Very satisfied with refurbished product; price, delivery and performance.  Very happy with choice. The computer itself is good. Several problems with this vendor but they have changed their name since I bought. Computer OK but for these issues./ 1: Cpu was only a 2.39 ghtz. 2: HDD kept cycling on in short 3 second bursts, sometimes as often as once a minute (VERY ANNOYING). Asked vendor for help and had no response from three queries.Talked to an IT friend and he said to check BIOS for upgrade. 1980a bios still in machine so downloaded update from Dell and problem fixed. 3: Few cosmetic issues like silver side cover fades and dark shadows. I think this will be a good buy if the hard drive holds up as I've noticed a lot of people who lost theirs within months. I was hesitant to buy a refurbished computer until my daughter recommended it., saying they often last longer than new off the shelf equipment. I can’t say enough about how much value I got with this purchase. The speed is phenominal compared to my two-year old desktop, I was able to plug and play. And even having relocated the unit twice for optional use of my home office space, it was easy to undo, relocate and re- set up. I am now convinced that refurb is a bargain with a like-new outcome! I will have to take some credit for this review since I have had issues with it since I received it.  My attempt to repair took longer than I thought and now it is to late to let the seller attempt to help me out.  Issue is I have been getting the Blue Screen of Death on this machine intermittently since I received it.  Attempts to track down the problem have not worked. JSM Computers is the BEST!!! Very Professional Seller! Top Quality! Exceeded My Expectations! Super Fast Shipping! Will Definitely Use Again! Will Definitely Recommend! My first experience buying a refurbished PC was not a good one. This was a Christmas gift for my in-laws to replace their aging, slow machine. What we got was a refurbed PC that could barely boot. We were able to return and get a refund.",1,1
"I was a bit worried that the product would come as a loose item, but it came as if I ordered it straight from Alex and Ani; it came with the little black bag and the card that describes the charm. Also it arrived in one day, which was two days earlier than it was supposed to. This was a gift for my sister, she loves it! I love this ring and have ordered it in gold, silver and rose gold. No issues with the silver or rose. However I ordered a few for gifts and almost all were tarnished. I had to send back multiple times. Perfect little ring Love this ring! I asked for this ring to wear as an everyday replacement for my wedding ring. It looks & feels great! It is made out of silver so it is soft & does scratch easily. Cute and pretty ring, costume jewelry, great for Women, Teens and Tweens. Nice ring, but the size doesn't fit true to form. Needs to be bent a little, to fit. It's a nice color, and price. Ring is very nice and comfortable. Gave it 4 stars only because it looks all scratched, but I can deal with it.",1,1
"It’s not 100% leather. It’s leather and some other cardboard-like material. I had to cut it to size which was pretty easy. I had a little problem using the hole punch to cut through the cardboard-like material. Once it punched through, it punched cleanly. It’s an okay belt. The buckle is nice. The leather of the belt is very sturdy.I don't see any problem of this all are perfectly work and the quality as well. It comes with tools and directions to shorted and adjust this belt for smaller waisted. Great quality!! It is one size fits most.  If you take the time to read about the belt you would see that you can take off the buckle end, trim to your size, and replace the buckle without punching more holes! Quite easy!! Tools also include in the package. Very impressive. Looks great. Just not thick enough to hold up today’s modern jeans with stretch in the fabric. The belt looks very trendy, good quality, and very convenient with the tool to adjust the belt! Great Quality Well packaged as gift box, simple but elegant buckle, strong belt. It met my expectations.",1,1
"I bought them for my husband as he's so busy and needed some shoes that I just went for it and bought a couple of pairs of Skechers for him. He bought a pair some months back so I was fairly sure the size would be the same across their shoes and it was. I bought these and a pair of the slip on loafers and he was appreciative of both. Both comfortable. True to size. Nice looking for casual and business casual. They are very lightweight, too, and he really likes that too. I'm going to keep buying him Skechers because they last, look good and I can trust buying him shoes without trying them on. Hubby loves these shoes. He wore basically the same black boots day in and day out, yet would complain when they started to smell or break down within a year of purchase. He also complained about not having a good pair of casual shoes that could be dressed down with denim or dressed up for work. (Okay so that was more of my requirement, but now he loves the versatility of these shoes.) He has worn them for a 8-9 hour work day without complaint of his feet hurting. He says the memory foam is very comfy. His feet have not been sweaty or smelly since he began wearing these shoes, but he has only worn them with socks, never barefoot. These are such great shoes that I plan to do more research into the Sketchers lien of Relax Fit shoes to see what else is available for him to continue rotating his shoes. Very light-weigh, solid build.My main complaint - not enough padding on the back of the shoe, which forced me to buy and install ""heel grips"" - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BD71JK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. Next time will be looking for something more comfortable. I am a fan of Skechers Relaxed Fit, but I wish they would not discontinue styles so often. Although I have bought some ""SRF"" styles that were not well-designed, this ""Expected Gembel Oxford"" pair was a good purchase. Sometimes a size-12 shoe (""my size"") will be too tight, and I could not afford to buy un-wearable shoes this time, so I got these in size 13. They are a little bit loose, but comfortable and usable. (They slip down my heel slightly as I walk, but they do not hurt at all.) I will probably be wearing these every day for many months. I wouldn't try running in these shoes: they are more like outdoor slippers. The front half and rear half of the shoe seem to be the same size. (Sometimes you buy shoes, and the fronts seem like size-14 while the rears seem like size-11.) Worst shoes I've ever owned. I've always liked Sketchers, but these shoes are downright dangerous. After wearing them for one day, I had a massive gaping wound above my heel where the back of the shoe dug into my skin. It was at least 1.5"" wide and very painful. It's been 3 weeks since I received them and the wound still hasn't fully healed. Impressed by the quality and how light these shoes are. I have become a big fan of sketchers over the past couple years, as they have always been very durable and generally lightweight (except one pair of running shoes that I think are made of heavy metal).  These have a comfortable insole, are comfortable to walk in, and I think they really look sharp.  They just seem to run a bit larger than expected for me.  I would say they feel about 1/2 size larger than normal and feel a little wider. Which is great because it gives me extra space and my foot doesnt feel crunched like my former shoes of a similar style that I have had for a long time. They rubbed the back of my heel for a while. I have finally started to break them in better. They are comfortable and light. There is elastic on each side of the lace, and I am not sure it will last for a long time. that stuff tends to stretch and not come back after a while. Had I realized there was elastic on them, I wouldn't have purchased them. Overall, they are good and comfortable shoes. Very comfortable shoes.  I had a lighter colored pair, which I wore all summer and wanted a darker pair for the winter.  These are shoes I can wear all day and they are still comfortable at the end of the day.  The shoes fit as expected.  Also, I wore my first pair a lot this summer and even though I did a lot of walking, they hardly show any wear and tear.  I use an oil sponge on them once in awhile and they look like they just came out of the box.",1,1
"For some reason, even though I put clipon earrings into the search, some earrings for pierced ears came up. I was aware of this, but somehow missed it in these. It was disappointing because it was a gift for my daughter. The earrings themselves are cute and a good size for girls (my daughter is 7). The quality is good, for inexpensive jewellery, and there is a nice mix. She loved them, and it's great for kids to have the nice box and open it to an array of earrings. She'll probably get her ears pierced when she's 10, so I decided to put them away until then rather than return them. Wow, these are gorgeous. These ear rings do NOT look like they run just over $2 a pair! The attention to detail is quite evident in the production of these ear rings. They look expensive, and can definitely accessorize a fine dinner dress without any suspicion of how inexpensive they are! I will likely buy a second set (or third) as a Christmas gift. I have sensitive ears, and I've had no reaction to these ear rings. They arrived well sealed in an attractive blue box sealed in cellophane in a bubble wrap package in the time specified. The box itself is attractive enough to use as the gift box - just stick a bow on it.  Well done!!! These earrings are awful! The quality is terrible. The owls are more like smudges and the penguins were downright creepy! Their eyes weren't even painted in the correct spots!  The foxes were cute and the turtles weren't bad either, just not very sharp details.  But the kicker was that there was a hair elastic randomly in the box... WITH HAIR STUCK TO IT!!!!  The sad truth is that I half expected to see a note asking for help from a Chinese factory worker tucked in the box as well. They are really cute and work perfectly with my sensitive skin. I have fallen asleep with them on a couple of times and no problem. My three year old wears all of the plastic kid ones and I use the turtles, pearls and metal ones. We both love them and have gotten a lot of compliments. . Cute earrings.  I bought them for my 9 year old and she likes them.  I thought they would be smaller but they are still cute.  They have not bothered her ears yet but I do take them out daily.  They come with the metal backing as well as rubber backings.  I like the rubber backings better because I feel they are more secure. Purchased for my little girl and she loves them.  Only bone to pick would be that the dangly earring (which she loved most) fell apart almost immediately :( These are HUGE and not for a child….my 10 yr old grand-daughter recently got her ears pierced and I thought these would be fun for her - I returned them! These are ok.  I got them for my 3 year old daughter and they are a bit large for her ears.  other than that they seem to be nice quality",1,1
"I hate wearing dress shoes but have to for work. So whenever I travel for business I usually bring a pair of more casual shoes for going out on the town with colleagues as we often do after meetings. Wearing size 13-14 shoes means traveling with an extra pair is difficult. I wanted to find a pair of shoes that was business-attire appropriate (these aren't formal), wouldn't break the bank, and above all COMFORTABLE enough to wear all day/night. I tried Ecco and other supposedly all-day comfort dress shoes but to no avail. I was beginning to think such a shoe didn't exist. I overlooked these initially since the lower price made me think they couldn't possibly be as good or better than Ecco but after trying them on I was sold. THESE are the shoes I was looking for all along. I have never owned a more comfortable a pair of business/dress shoes. Now I just bring one pair of shoes on trips and if I go out on the town with colleagues I can just keep these on.  I wouldn't wear them with a tux (i never wear a tux anyway) but they are fine for office/work, jacket and tie, presentations at meetings/conferences etc., and since they aren't patent leather (and even less shiny than they appear in the photo), they also dress down acceptably with jeans.  I used to throw off my work shoes the instant I got home. After getting these, I started noticing that I would subconsciously keep them on all night. Now THAT is the ultimate indicator of comfort. So far, so good, but I haven't worn the shoes enough to break them in. Very lightweight (which is good), and fits perfectly (Size 12 EE). So far, the shoe is quite comfortable.  I've been a fan of Rockport for years. Most Rockports have been very good, but a couple have been less than comfortable and not as durable as I wanted.  The jury is still out for these shoes, so I may update my review a few months from now. These are the lightest and most comfortable dress shoes on the market. Since purchasing these shoes I've had zero foot discomfort and my legs feel great. I have been a corporate trainer for several years and have searched the world for shoes that were lightweight, provide good support, and were professional looking. These are all of these qualities and I have recommended them to all of my colleagues. I purchased my first pair at Dillard's and immediately ordered another pair on Amazon. My next purchase will be the slip-on version of this shoe. Hold up to the brand reputation as far as fit, and comfort are concerned. Much lighter than the ones I bought 3 yrs ago, because of a lighter sole. I gave it four stars because it is too warm for my liking. My feet are sweating in an air conditioned room (72 F) as I write this review. I already had a pair of these and knew the size I needed. The new pair were created exactly the same as the pair I bought two years ago and I thoroughly love them. I have wide feet so purchasing online is worrisome. But I took a chance due to the great deal and my previous success with Rockport shoes. They are light and very comfortable. The fit was right on the money. I love these shoes, and would purchase again in a heartbeat. This is a realy comfortable pair of shoes. I've liked the synthetic soles and heels on the last few pairs of shoes I've had. These are bether than most so far. My office has a modern style with mostly polished concrete flooring. Not only have thsee shoes have been quiet on the floor they have also been easy on my feet. Felt great right out of the box.  Super light in weight with great support.  I am a school principal and am on my feet all day.  Nice to buy shoes that are sized correctly.",1,1
"While I have used some professional video cameras several years ago, this is my first purchase of a camcorder personally!  I was looking for a portable camcorder to start taking some HD video. LAKASARA has produced a camera with plenty of bells and whistles, but unfortunately doesn't take smooth video.",-1,-1
"I know Camel is a reputable brand in China for outdoor gears, so I got a pair of Camel hiking shoes together with a pair of Columbia hiking shoes to compare. I chose two pairs with similar designs so that the comparison is apples to apples. They are also similarly priced. I bought this pair of shoes not just for hiking, but also for regular wear during snowy winter days. My experience so far can be summarized as follows: These boots are very good quality product. They are solid and strong, and at the same time are not too heavy, Should be ideal for hiking or camping. The only concern was regarding the size. The chart shows the largest size they have as EU - 44 --> US 9.5 which is not right, as 44EU is my EU size, and so is 10.5-11 US. Moreover, the boots I received are labeled with 44EU and 9US!!! That is completely wrong. I purchased Camel hiking shoes for my son. He is member of outdoor zone club. As a parent, I like good quality with  affordable price. As for me, this shoes as good as popular and expensive brand product. Nicely made, looks great. It has nice weight to it and good slip- resistant sole.  Comes with extra shoes laces. So far, he really likes it. I wish they would make shoes in bigger sizes. My husband like them to. A quality shoe. I normally wear a size 9.5 but bought a size 10 since I have a somewhat wide foot. Very comfortable and sturdy. True to size, very comfortable! I tried a different brand of boot and they felt cheap but was blown away at how well these are made! A great buy for the price and quality. Good quails as decried. The size is just right for me. Love it. Ordered size 9 and received size 8",1,1
"Always buy these. They're sturdy, long lasting, easy to clean and a good size. We take out the straw, as the kids prefer to drink lifting the water bottle instead of keeping it in standing position, which is required if the straw is in. Very easy to remove and put back if you want. Beautifully designed, sturdy, and leak-proof! Superb!! Leak free",1,1
"- I received these a day early, which was great! These are cheap glasses I got for Halloween and they will work perfectly for that and that alone. I popped out the frames immediately so I don't have to worry about them falling out late. I knew these were going to be cheap plastic glasses, but the lens popped out after my 6 year old wore them one time and I have been unable to get the lens back in.  He wore them to be the character from the Magic Tree House books at school.  Definitely not a great investment!  I would not recommend these glasses unless you are in a pinch (Like we were.  Thank you for Prime shipping!) Worked great for the 100th day of school! They are super cute and are not a prescription! Very nice red glasses.  Look great with my costume. Reasonable and expected shipping time, and the price is good! They are sturdy and do not feel cheap at all. I bought these in red for a Halloween costume (the Log Lady from the TV show Twin Peaks), and the shape is perfect but they are a bit too bright in color. This is fine though, as I plan to paint them! The shape and size are perfect for what I needed. Would recommend! Brown is much darker than the picture so I’m disappointed. At least they were cheap Granddaughter loves them",1,1
"I originally bought these just for the gloves because I needed large hats and gloves for my 1 month old who was a big baby and everything was just too small on him. Plus I was making a custom “elf on the shelf” costume for him and these were the perfect gloves for it. It worked for the costume so I really can’t complain because that’s what I needed it for. However, I only gave it 4 stars because they don’t stay on very long. They fall off easily because there is no elastic on the end. Cute and versatile. Especially for unisex baby clothes. Great price. Nice material, soft and delicated Love these!  Super soft and practical for the baby as the weather shifts to cooler.  These express ""pure"" so sweetly.  Four unisex organic cotton (made in Egypt)  - Size 0/S. This is an adorable set of very soft, organic, cotton caps and mittens for baby. The white color is perfect as it is completely unisex and can easily be used for either girls or boys. Also, the white color means they literally go with any other clothing or wraps that the baby is wearing. Newborns need to have their head protected to prevent heat loss, even when the weather is temperate. Also, the mittens not only keep baby's hands warm, but also are great as scratch protectors for baby. We really love this set. It is easy care--wash with mild soap in the machine on cold cycle and you can tumble dry on low. The set of 4 means it is easy to always have a clean cap and pair of mittens available when needed. Plus, this item would make a lovely shower or new baby gift, too (although, just as an FYI, mine did not arrive in a gift box or a box of any kind for easy gift wrapping--you may have to supply your own box if you purchase these as a gift). Another reviewer also suggested that because these items are free from decoration, the purchaser can choose to decorate them and personalize them, too. I think that's a wonderful idea, and it makes this set of baby essentials even more versatile. These Are excellent quality hats and mitts. Not super thin like other brands. The cotton is soft and the cuffs keep the mitts on. Hats fit newborn and stretch so if you gave a bigger baby, or want to us them for several months they'll still fit. Quality and material is even better than Carter's. The design and fit of the mitts is the best I have used. The material feels so much nicer and they stay on much better. I have only tried a few items from Moon and Back brand, but everything has been excellent. All of the items look and feel like  a premium brand. Quality product by Moon and Back, an Amazon company. I have bought other clothing products from different Amazon Brands and have not been impressed until now. Very reasonably priced set of caps and mittens made of very soft organic Egyptian cotton. Quality contraction with overlooking hems inside. Quite impressed with the brand. They look to run slight bigger than another set I have so I washed in warm water and dried on low heat in dryer, that shrieked a bit before using. If you plan on buying as a gift it comes in a plastic baggie, no product packaging. The hat and mitten set is simply adorable and well made!  I love that each of the colors/patterns can coordinate or match depending on how you style.  The sizing is right on with other 0-6 month sized hats, but the mittens might be slightly large depending on the baby's wrist.  I might love it even more if it came with two 0-6 month size hats/mittens and two 6-12 month size hats/mittens, but that would just be my preference in packaging.  The weight of the fabric is ideal for spring/fall in mild climates.",1,1
"I love it!!! Came with everything! Best gift ever I loooooove my cameras sooo cute, and everything that comes with it is just sooooooo cute!!!!!!!  The only thing is that photo quality is not es expected, is very nice but not as I thought. And picture takes atlas 5 second to finish coming out! lol overall it is nice. Not 5 starts, but worth it. Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She specifically wanted the ice blue one. It came quickly just as expected with all the accessories. Yes the instructions are in another language and the packaging, but that really wasn’t a big deal for us. The camera is super easy to setup. Yes the photo album says “pieces of moment” but my daughter loved that especially. She said it’s unique. Extremely pleased with my purchase. Now if she could stop going through the film so fast we would be great!! Hehe. I got this as a gift for my 12 yr old granddaughter.  She mentioned wanting it and I was excited to see her wanting something ""old school"".  It was a huge hit.  The camera worked great and she loved having real pictures to hang on her mirror and share with her friends This had to be the cutest little camera! My 15 yr old loved it! Remindes me of back when I used Polaroid instant cameras. The case is super cute and all the accessories included to make crafty frames and hues are an added bonus to making this fun to use. Fun!! It’s great to have the younger generation experience the camera and film like when I was young. I bought two of these for my adult children for Christmas and although they are both into high tech items, they loved these! I love the colors they come in and enjoy seeing little pictures of my animals stuck around the house! I bought this bundle for my grandkids for Christmas. I ordered it in October. The snap on the case for it won’t stay snapped and I can’t return it because it’s been too long. Just realizing that it’s not an actual Instax case it’s an after market one. I thought it would be an instax case since it was a bundle. Wish it would of said that in the description.",1,1
"Would definitely buy again, easy to change links and adjust as well assuper cute! I received my bumpers today. Came on time and I received it earlier than usual. Very easy to understand the directions. Clear is a very neutral color for my watch. If I happen to bump my watch it will be fully protected. Makes my watch look beautiful. Quality is good.  Looks nice to dress up my watch.  It’s a nice change from the other “plastic like” bands.  Now I can wear my watch to all occasions!! It fits almost perfectly.  When you have a large wrist, it's hard finding wrist bands that fit.  I can barely tell it’s there.  I will be ordering more. This is a beautiful watch band! I would recommend it to all rose gold lovers. It matches the rose gold iPhone exactly! 👍🏽😊 The only problem we had is that my daughters wrist is really small, so after removing all links the chain part was still too big. Love love love it feels very nice it look rich not cheat I will be ordering more from this seller I'm trying to get more colors that matches my work uniforms n the face cover r awesome too... It arrived in timely manner and was easy to slip into my apple watch. Unfortunaltely it was too small and I need two more links. How can I request extra links? Pros- the links come out making the watch fit for any size wrist.",1,1
"Well made , looks beautiful They came in the mail sooner than I expected. They look exactly like the picture, the only thing is that the color is more electric than the ones on the picture. Other than that they are beautiful Can you believe it?  Such cute earrings for such a low price.  They are quite beautiful.  I received another pair that have similar backs, that were awfully barbed and rough, but these seem to be fine.  They did arrive with badly bent posts, but that is pretty easy to fix.  I just love the color.  And the stones are very clear and pretty.  They seem to be well made.  I will update if my opinion changes. The only reason this is getting a three star review is because I can still wear them. When I received the earrings they were loose in a plastic bag, usually earrings come attached to some kind of plastic or cardboard card. The posts were both bent completely flat, thankfully I was able to unbend them by hand. This flattening looked to be a result of poor packaging. The clasp on one broke off the first time I opened it. Because there was no way to reattach it, I broke the second clasp off, much too easily. Thankfully I have extra backs so I can still wear the earrings without the clasps, but it was disappointing that it was broken when I received it. My final issue with the earrings is with the color. Instead of a nice navy blue, its a muddy black/blue. The color is nice enough, but not what I was expecting. Finally arrived after waiting for about two months. The product is not even close to what is shown in photo. Its really some cheap shinny royal blue paint, on the petals. The post at the back came twisted, but I carefully straighten them. My ears start hurting after 15 mins of wearing them, and my skin is not so sensitive to metals. Well I get for what I paid for. Lesson learned! These earrings look very expensive. I love how they attach to my ears. Not too big not too small. I couldn't believe how well they packed them. Wrapped in bubble wrap, placed in a bubble wrap envelope. They remind me of stars in the night sky. Beautiful!! These earrings are super inexpensive and they are very pretty. They are simple and not very heavy on the ears. I don’t know about you but I don’t really like super heavy earrings, they make me feel uncomfortable and after a while I have to take them off. These are actually fairly light and as I said before, very pretty :) These little blue earrings are so cute and made well for the price.  I thought they would be flimsy and not have substance to them, but wrong I was.",1,1
"Love these!! They were a lot better of a quality then I thought for the price. I haven't had any issue with them dropping, but that just may be my ear. The stones are very sparkly which was a nice surprise for the price. This are beautiful. I am a big fan of earring crawlers, and purchase them frequently. These are now a pair of my favs. Beautiful, the stones sparkle more than I expected, and these do not have that cheap element where they look like they'll fall apart or turn green without provocation. The earrings are really pretty. They do slip down occasionally and one of them (the left one) is shaped slightly different which is a little bit annoying. They are studs which I like but I think they will just take a little bit of getting used to. Looks great as far as quality...but kept slipping down during wear and looks more like a dangle earring than a crawler-even when I wore it tightly. Overall nice earnings. Wow!  Just received these. They are cute but one of the backs didn’t have a hole in it. I had to poke it through with another earring. The post on these bent just putting them in my ears. Good thing I only bought these as a joke to wear on a trip I am taking with my sisters. These are very pretty Very nice. I really like the shine and the small details. I am able to fit them in a piercing on the top of my ear and it curves around to fit perfectly. Love my ear crawlers. 💜💜💜💜💜",1,1
"The only bad review was a misunderstanding . The belt comes with the buckle off so you can size it for yourself . You just put the belt inside the flip switch slot and put it on . Then if you put it on and have too much extra take it back off and cut that much off from the end that goes in the buckle with good sewing scissors . I was lucky the belt is 1300 mm , 130 cm long or roughly  51 inches long . So if you have two ridiculous inches over cut it off the end that goes in the buckle . Just remember you can't add back on so leave as much as you can incase you gain weight . I usually go a few inches past the first pant  loop because I gain and loose allot of weight at times . Some  people like to just go a few inches past the belt loop but thats cutting it close if you ask me and as you age you will buy allot of new belts when you get around 35 and up . I was 135 in High School and now weigh 240 ;-) currently wear size 42 pants and trim non off . Should fit when I go to 44's or not hopefully . I came back and bought more colors nice belt . My husband was stunned when I gave him this belt, it is heavy duty and looks like it will wear forever.  The buckle is very sharp looking, heavy duty and attractive.  It was very quick and easy to put the belt together.  My husband aims to dress well, and this belt is the perfect addition to his wardrobe.  I can see it lasting for years, unlike the crap he buys from the local department stores that split and break.  Very sharp looking. I liked these belts since my teen days but glad to find it back again on amazon. Absolutely like this belt, very smooth finishing. It comes in long enough size to be adjusted to any waist size with the use of pair of scissors. The buckle is very robust and looks good. One of the advantage of this belt is you don't have to tug anything in holes and therefore gives longer life. Purchased this belt after seeing some videos on the “ratchet buckles” - they work great! I was little confused as to how to take it off at first. Just look at the bottom of the Buckle and you’ll see a little switch you can move that releases it! High Quality product, but directions should be improved, and written out in English.  Had difficulty figuring out how to release catch to remove, which caused me to reduce the rating by 1 star.  Soft leather and very attractive buckle. Heavy duty, stylish, belt buckle.  I love the adjustable ratchet idea.  The belt itself seems to be really good quality and has a nice finish.  I am very happy with this purchase. Ok the best part about this belt is when you’ve worn it out you can cut an inch or two off by the buckle clasp, reclasp, hang or coil for a day and presto close to a new belt. I love the design of this belt, don't even have to worry about looking for the holes. It comes extra lengths, which makes it perfect since I was worry that it might be too short. Instead now I could just cut the extra portions off and fitted myself. Having a release switch is a pretty wicked idea. Took me awhile to figure that out, but it comes out smoothly.",1,1

"I stayed as much as I can in the video but I didn’t really get to express how impressed I was by the bass on these headphones. This is a very nice quality and weight.  I use them for working out and my music sounds really great.  I have taken telephone calls and it is easy to take calls and to hear the party calling you very clearly.  I asked for feedback on the sound of my voice on the other end and I got great responses. The size is compact and the design is sharp.  I really like these. When I got these headphones, I was fairly sceptical. I started using them last Saturday afternoon 11/25/17. Today 12/3/17, I have yet to charge them and I have been using them very consistently for hours per day. The sound quality is medium, not Beats but also not the $5 earphones either. They vibrate when you are getting a call and fold when you're not using them. Below I've compiled a list of pros and cons about these headphones: the new wire retraction design is definitely useful and cool.the retractable ear piece makes easy to wear the head under my collar at work.Sound quality is great and I love that they are sweat/water resistant. The first thing I saw when I looked at this headset was probably how bulky it was. It being heavy is both a good and bad. It meant that, one, it was built well and shouldn't break easily, and two, that it probably would not be good for running because of the excessive knocking. This is my first pair of around the neck headphones. I have to say I really like them. They are wireless Bluetooth, the sound quality is pretty Amazing also. They hold a charge works for a few gym workouts, which is a very good battery charge. The quality-of phone call clarity is quite impressive, since my car does not have Bluetooth & I wear them This head set is great! Its a great deal for the money.  It comes with extra ear buds in assorted sizes. The sound quality is perfect for what I need it for, I listen to music all day while at work and i can hear all sounds just fine. Its very light around my neck and i dont feel like if i dropped it would break, its very sturdy. The battery has lasted me up to 10 hours i have never used it tho more then that length of time, if i go to use it the next day it does have to be recharged as the battery is depleted that could also be because i didn't turn it off lol .  It was very simple to connect the bluetooth to my iPhone. It found it very quick . Each ear bud is retractable by pressing a button on each side of each ear bud , and one can be pulled out at a time both dont have to be extended to use , just use one at a time or both.  It also came with a. great charger that does the job. No complaints here. I would recommend this as a very good purchase.  I own the same style ones made by 2 other brands however if you had no names on the items i wouldn't be able to tell you which one was the brand, thats how good the quality is.  I wasn't able to test if i was working out, or outside, but moving back and forth all day they stay on!",1,1

"I bought this for my 5yo daughter to help her learn to tell time.  I started by looking at the watches with Disney characters on them but they all felt cheap and the digital clock was too tiny to be of much use.  I saw this one and took a chance based on the reviews.  For the price I didnt expect much but honestly this product has exceeded my expectations. Got this watch for my daughter as a gift.  She put it on immediately the day I received it.  I can see her face glow.  It's been a week since I got it.  There's never a day gone by she not wearing it.  A perfect gift for an eight years old who starts appreciating time. This watch my girls loves it. She got to take it in the pool with her the material was great it fits great. It was easy to open. And it came in a nice small box where you can store it when not in use. It was simple to set up the time. It came with instructions. This water proof girls watch is great compared to other watch we have bought this one was probably one of the best. Definitely will recommend this girls water proof watch. Got this amazing watch for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!! She's completely happy with her watch and I love that it has to set an alarm so it motivates her to get up in the mornings specially because she loves it. It fits perfectly on her small wrist and has different color lights and different functions. Really recommend!! This watch is very helpful and it has a lot of different functions such as lighting up in different colors like red, green, blue and flash, which is all of the different colors together, so it is possible to see the watch in the dark.  Another function is that it has a stopwatch to time anything. My favorite is an alarm that can be changed to anytime, which helps my daughter wake up for school and other events.  It is very lightweight and comfortable to wear.  The watch doesn't have a face like other watches, only numbers, so it is very helpful for kids that can't read time. This watch has been work perfectly so far. I don't need to worry about it get wet when my daughter washes her hands or plays with water. The lavender color is playful and the material is soft enough. She really into watch now and wear it everyday even though she doesn't know how to read it. Overall, It's a decent kid watch and worth its price. Great watch for the price!!! My daughter loves the color, how comfortable the band is and the multi color light option. What a cleverly designed watch for a young girl. She is to receive the watch soon as a birthday gift.Nice Watch",1,1
"I received this unit about a week ago. I love it! The screen size is slightly larger than two 8 1/2""x11""sheets of paper side by side, so it's perfect to leave, say, my email program open on the left and in a separate window on the right leave open my browser. Wow, I love this computer! Fast, simple to learn. Very user-friendly! Gave me too many sound problems great small unit. I purchased this for my senior mother. She is to say the least a computer novice. With the large bright touchscreen display and all in one design it was a perfect replacement for a very dated desktop. Setup was about an hour with all the Windows updates. So far we have not had any issues with any apps or programs. I LOVE this computer. It is fast and the display is beautiful. Very pleased with my purchase. Great system by Lenovo. Arrived on time with no damages. Just plug and play. No hassles! Perfect!!!!",1,1
"I bought this 150 set of Prismacolor pencils before  about 2 weeks now and did some drawings . This is a great set. Prismacolors are worth the praise they always get. They are creamy and smooth. I've had no breakage and they come in a nice tin. I think they are vivid and blend very well. It comes with a good variety of colors for a 24 pencil set. I highly recommend these! I am 200% amazed by the outcomes of these great colors.  They are very easy to blend and layer. When I first opens the box, the pencils looked so ordinary that I was a little sad. But after I used them to do some work, they surprised me. The colors are incomparable to those cheap pencils  I used to have. It seems that the pencil itself knows how to read my mind, lol! It works with me! Here is what the 72 count set of colors looks like... Unfortunately, I didn't think of taking a picture before I bought 3 more pencils individually. The ones with the check marks in front of the set were the 3 additional ones that I bought. These are great for layering and shading. I bought a 36 count of the Prismacolor Verithins for darker lines. They work well together and each one has it's own purpose. I'm not an artist just an adult that has picked up coloring before bedtime to relax. I only wish that I would have bought one of the larger count sets since I am always looking for additional colors. With all due respect to the glowing reviews for this product, I must respectfully weigh in here. I've used Prismacolor Premier colored pencils for the past 25 years. Having recently purchased a large set for my older daughter on Amazon, I can say with 100% confidence that this brand has declined STEEPLY in quality. I compared my old set of 72 with her new set, and even being considerably older than my own child, the original Prismas are distinctly higher in quality. Her new set came with SERIOUSLY off-centered leads, wooden shafts that are either cracked or completely different colors from one half to the other, and most concerning, the cores in many of the pencils seems to be waxier and clumps/flakes no matter what we do. I even found one pencil stamped with a misspelled color name; not a deal-breaker in and of itself, but clearly another indication of the level (or lack thereof) of quality control.",1,1

"So cute!! Would definitely recommend!! Way way smaller than expected. I don't even know if it would fit a doll. Also says that it's black but it's actually navy blue. And says it's cotton but there is no doubt that it's actually a spandex material. Feels like a swim suit! No use in returning it took almost three weeks to get and was only six bucks. Outfit is adorable but the weird head wrap is too big in fact I intend to wear it on my head. Totally worth the $5 I paid for it. It would be better if it were pre- tied I have received a million compliments on this romper. It is SO cute and comfy on my little girl. The headband definitely does not work, though. That's the only reason that I docked a star. Other than that, we love it! This outfit is adorable. I ordered size 0-6 months and the sizing is typical for 0-6 months clothes. The material is nice, silky, and breathable. However, be careful with the buttons, because when I unbutton them it feels like they're going to rip off of the fabric. Overall good buy. My daughter isn't born yet but I bought the 0-6 month size and I'm sure that it will fit fine at some point within that time frame.  My complaint is the material and the headband.  The material is cheap spandex, which I can't stand.  The headband is big enough for me and I'm 33.  The outfit will be fine for a simple summer's day outfit (as long as the buttons don't have an issue, as other's have mentioned). Super cute... but im going to end up ripping it trying to get the snaps open to change her diaper. It's cute for a picture but it is poorly made, if stretched at all looks really bad and headband is huge. My daughter wore it one time for a picture and that was it",1,1

"I purchased the all black converse for my husband. They arrived in great condition and extremely fast. He is usually a 10 in shoes but reading other reviews made me (hesitantly) get a half size smaller. Which I am happy to say was the right choice. The 9.5's fit him perfectly. Will defiantly be purchasing more colors in the future. Great shoes, the color is perfect. They were for my son and I'm jealous. Now I want a pair. Very good shoes, fast shipping! Got here in time for. Christmas even though it said it would arrive after. So happy! Size was perfect! We switched the laces to black elastic ones so he would not have to tie his shoes anymore and to make the black pop. Love them! Our daughter wanted a pair of these shoes for Christmas.  She was shown how to ladder lace them by her cousin and she has been wearing them for casual and her dress up days for sporting events at school.  They look super cute with jeans and a sweater. Perfect! Love them! Bought the navy color.  I ordered size 8 women’s. I vary between 8 and 8.5 and the 8’s were perfect and it even had a tiny bit of extra room. These shoes are awesome! I was so excited to get a pair at such a great deal. Vibrant color (I got the red) and they fit perfectly. Converse is pretty much always in Men's sizing so if you are a woman you have to go down 2 sizes (ex: I am a Women's size 8 so I got a Men's 6). My feet are of normal or medium width so the 6(B)M fit great. Converse makes pretty comfortable shoes so you can wear them all day and they last a very long time if you aren't too crazy and are careful. I get compliments all the time and I love them Tbese seem to run a bit large. They are pretty much the same as the ones I wore a long time ago in high school. Even the tread pattern on the sole is the same. They are lighter than most sneakers today and cooler. The canvas breathes and your feet sweat less than when you wear leather shoes. I purchased these for my husband and loves them. He wanted a playful shoe for our play vacations to disney world, and other casual events. Personally, I am not crazy about them on a grown man, but he is very youthful and they work well for him with his casual jeans or cargo shorts. He loves them and is quite happy. these fit exactly as expected.  I am GLAD i did not listen to other reviews, and buy a half size larger.",1,1
"If buying tea in bulk is wrong, I don't wanna be right. This tea is part of my nightly ritual and we've gone through two boxes so far. Not having to go to the store frequently is awesome. The chamomile tea taste great, no stale or bitter after taste even when steeped for a very long period. Great for helping with relaxing in the evening. Nice strong flavor, very good taste. I was expecting a weaker brew out of this for the money I paid, somehow, but not so. Great value overall, I have no complaints at all. I really like this tea.  It has a great flavor and the individually wrapped packs are great for storing when buying in bull so they don't go stale! I love stash tea. Everything I purchased from this company has been tasty and delicious and well packaged. I sent this box as a friend who needed a little bit of relaxing chamomile, but I drink this stuff everyday. This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as ""water pills""  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket. Really good quality for a reasonable price. This is my go to sleep-aid, and this brand has a full chamomile flavor without that grassy tannin type flavor from a cheaper or older tea. I absolutely love this Chamomile tea. At about noon every day at work I can feel a little anxiety creeping, and a cup or two of this tea nips it right in the bud!  I love that the bags are easy to open, and it comes as just 100 teabags inside of a plain 'ol cardboard box.",1,1
Super fast shipping . Great quality ring :) AWESOME ring.  Sturdy and colorful.  Gets lots of compliments. I love it love it,1,1
"This arrived boxed and packaged very nicely with a soft green sleeve cover to store and protect. The thermometer is not only for babies but can be used on children of all ages. Instructions are easy to read and make setup simple.  It's easy to grip with fast and accurate readings. I would recommend to all moms to have on hand. I bought this for my daughter who is about to have her first baby. When I saw it I thought it would be a perfect little gift for her baby shower. I opened it up to check it out and it is kind of an all around thermometer. I think it is going to come in really handy. Got this for my baby to check temperature whenever she's not feeling well. Love the ability that i have the flexibility to choose to take her temperature on her forehead or in her ear. Great product! This thermometer is easy to get a quick and accurate measurement for everyone in the family.  Though it is designed for babies, it worked well for all ages.  It is super quick and easy to use, so you won't have to worry about squirmy babies not holding still.  You won't regret this purchase. Thermometer is lightweight and easy to use! The cap covering the ear probe is a little difficult to remove, but other than that, this works great. Easy to take temperature, color not to my taste but that is minor. Seemed to work well and accurately. very easy to use and very handy!!!!",1,1
"These shoes tore the 2nd time he wore them. Bought 2 pairs for my twin boys. They seem to be of good quality & really nice for the price also. My only concern is the Velcro is not a very big piece so I hope that it will hold up to them running & jumping around. Other than that there is one small side note : the bottom tread is a print of skulls with hair bows on...so it kind of looks like a girl skull but that's not a really big deal seeing as no one will ever really see the bottom...but any mom with a boy knows that they will say something...lol. I think it's just the tread they use on all of their shoes b/c these r labeled for boys. Fit was fine, but shoe was a little bulky/heavy and a seam on the inside was wrinkled with glue under it - so I couldn’t flatten it out. Something like that could be irritating to little feet. Returned and purchased Osh Gosh shoes from Amazon Prime for similar price. the strap broke (no longer stays on) after just 2 weeks of wear by my 6 year old son.  He does not play sports in it, just wears it to school. We purchased this product for our 5 year old son who has ASD. He has issues with fine motor skills as well as some sensory issues, so we never really know how he will react to clothing or shoes until he tries them on. I cannot emphasize enough how much he LOVES these shoes! They are easy to put on, comfortable, wide enough for his feet to feel comfortable and secure at the same time. Fit great and good quality shoe. Bought it for my 3 year old and 5 year old nephews. These shoes were very nice, I love the look. The problem for me is that they are too hard/stiff. I tried to have my son walk around in them to ""break them in"" but they just caused blisters on the back of his feet. Maybe with thicker socks and a lil larger size they may have worked. These shoes are wonderful. I got them for my 6 year old to go along with his school uniform., not too dressy and not too sporty-just right. I also picked this shoe because I didn't want my son to worry about his shoelace constantly coming undone-no worries during recess.",1,1

"Been wearing this ring for more than a month. Bold but yet not obnoxious. I literally do not take it off. Lift weights, clean, shower and get my hands dirty daily. It is very comfortable. Adjustable factor is great. It looks good on middle finger and other rings sit next to it well either on that same finger or the one next to it. Get lots of compliments. A great finger or knuckle ring. Heavy and well made. This was a nice-looking ring, like other posters have said. However, it's really not adjustable. The size it comes in (8?) the size that you get. I love this ring. The whole time I am wearing it, I just keep looking at it. I wear it on my middle finger, but it looks great on my thumb too. I am going to order two more. very nice Love it! Love it The fit is great !",1,1
"Extremely comfortable fit. Well constructed. No loose threads hanging. Longer life span expected than usual purchases. Will purchase again. Plenty of room in thighs and crotch area. Freedom of movement is much welcomed. I had been looking for these boxers for years.  These are the old BVD knit boxer design that disappeared from stores after Fruit of the Loom bought BVD. I had bought a package of Polyester type shorts in my size, then another in one size larger, then another in one size larger again, and none of them fit comfortably. Things were always being pinched, then I decided to try some cotton knit Shorts and what comfort, so I bought another package and I will continue to buy them in the future. Most comfortable briefs ever. Best quality and great fit. I hope they wear well also. A +++ returned for smaller size very comfortable",1,1

"Overall a great camera for the price. Take good 24MP in day light. Would recommend it to those whom want a looking for a great budget camera. Bought this as a product photography camera for our small custom furniture business. Takes great images. True to color, higher resolution than we'll ever need. The flash is a little harsh but without it the camera meters itself pretty well in non glaring light.  This is such an amazing digital camera. I love the quality of the pictures. I love the complete accessories that it comes with. This is a pretty good deal. The lens got a great far distance shots. Very easy to operate. Its cool that I can flip the screen upward, so i can take selfie pictures. Sorts of mode to chose.  I do not have any bad issue of using this instead I'm loving it. Over all great quality of a camera that I enjoy very much. Comes with the wide angle lens in a leather pouch and a fish Eye lens is also included in the box.  The battery was charged and I was able to turn the camera on. There's no SD card included in the box and needs to be purchased separately. Really like the pop up flash and also the rotating LCD display which can be rotated by 180°. Picture quality is good and like the fact that you can record videos and take pictures. I was a tad sceptical about this camera, having had a camera before that I found difficult to alter settings. This time I am delighted with the ease of finding what I want to find in the menu pages. Easy to use just point and click! Battery not run out yet so don't know how long it will last before needing a charge but very very pleased so far with this camera. I decided to get this camera because of a sprouting interest in photography. I didn’t want to buy an expensive camera as my beginning camera, so I bought this one. I was actually impressed, It takes pretty good photos and has a pop up flash as well as selfie flip display. Later on I will upgrade to higher quality and expensive camera but for now this camera is good enough. Just as an added note it does not come with a sd card that needs to be bought separately. Focusing is quick, and the camera is responsive - no problems rattling off a series of photos one after the other. The screen on the back of the camera is excellent - not had any issues seeing it in direct sunlight, which was a concern - and the controls are easy to get the hang of. After years of putting up with poor quality phone camera pictures, it's great to be able to take really high quality photos with a camera that is of comparable size and perhaps lighter than a phone. After a far-too-long conversation with a store assistant who told me more about cameras than I'll ever need to know and wanted to sell me far more camera than I could ever justify I stumbled home having picked one key points out of the nerdstream: ""lots of zoom"" . I trawled some Amazon reviews and found this. Surprisingly in the circumstances, it was a really good choice. It's a very capable little camera: the zoom really is amazing, the HD picture is awesome and it's incredibly easy to use well. And also very good value for money!",1,1

"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my brother and also one for his girlfriend in a lighter color. We had a very cold December in the Pacific Northwest this year and I figured the rest of winter would just get worse. So these were fashionable and functional. They fit perfectly and they both looked great in them. They also mentioned how warm they were. Great hat fits me perfectly I'm a 6' 1"" 300 lb man and it's great definitely will keep me warm strongly recommend if you're looking for a nice warm winter hat and your big-headed or big person or atest wears a 7""5/8 hat then this is for you. Great price, well made with good material and fast delivery. ☆☆☆☆☆ I was not expecting it to shed. It leaves huge chunks of ""fur"" all over.  With the amount that sheds off, I can't imagine this hat lasting very long if you wear it often. Excellent hat warm good ship time outstanding buy at 2x the price , i highly recommend Awesome hat My husbands gag stocking stuffer turned into his favorite gift 🤷‍♀️ It’s made extremely well, quality materials & very warm (he says) I received my trapper and I Absolutely love it! It fits perfectly and I'm snug as a bug! This is just simply awesome. Perfect fit and very stylish. Keeps me warm as well.",1,1

"Good !! Don't like the taste. Not good value for money paid. Fabulous combination between freshness, flavor, quality, price, portion and variety. Brilliant Amazing snack,i always eat with some coffee in the morning or in the afternoon. It's delicious, and mainly healthy! You can always carry in your purse in case you might get hungry Tastes like crap VERY TASTY The assortment pack has all the flavors. After ordering it I start ordering the ones I liked a lot. Only I don’t see the black sesame flavor. It was great. I wish they had that option for me to purchase. I think they have to name this product something like Sesame seeds super-pack. Absolutely unique taste. Surprisingly good! Loved the black seeds. Those were the best!",1,1

"Very nice stylish earrings. Lovely earring set comes in silver and rose gold! Attached is a picture of what the earring looks like on. I love these earrings! It comes with a silver pair and a gold pair. I'm not much of a gold wearer but both pairs are super unique and pretty! I normally have issues with earrings bothering me but these have not and I have had them in since I got them! Love these! Wear both pieces or just the studs. I orginally was planning on keeping a pair for myself and giving the other to my mom but I think they are both mine!! These look nice from a distance. The gold is a very brassy gold, the silver looks much better. Great concept not sure how long they will hold up though These are very unusual and different than i am used to. I get so many compliments on them. Love them! Comes with both colors and they are perfect size! Beautiful ear rings!! I always show them off!!",1,1
"UPDATE: I have had this band for about 2 months. It still looks brand new and has no loose features and I wear it everyday. Still just as in love with it. Well at this price I didn't expect it to last forever but it only made it 10 days.  I expected cosmetic issues, like the material peeling or cracking but instead the metal bar that clicks in to the watch broke.  The first time I fixed it with an eyeglass screwdriver.  The second time my watch fell off my hand and hit the concrete.  Not trying to fix it again.  The $16 price of this band is definitely not worth the price of breaking or losing your apple watch. So cute! My best friend actually ordered it for me & it looks so good with the rose gold watch! Definitely would recommend! Doesn't hurt wrist or anywhere, nothing negative to say! ❤️ This was a impulse purchase for my significant other as she has an Apple Watch. This band looks nice and feels solid on the wrist but it is not without points of failure. The band clipped into the watch housing easily but after a few weeks of use, the metal bar holding the strap to the metal clip inside the watch housing came unscrewed releasing the watch. Luckily the watch was undamaged. The clip has two screws holding down the curved bar looped through the strap. These screws have repeatedly come undone since the initial failure. Screwing these screws back in is a difficult task since it requires a very small screwdriver. Also, if this screw falls out outside somewhere it will be next to impossible to find due to its size. In the end, this is a nice and reasonably priced watch band and I don't believe that I paid too much for what I received, but it is not without some drawbacks. I really like the colors in this watchband.  It fits my Apple Series 2 very nicely.  I have small wrists and usually have to cut down bands but this one fits just right.  It has a lot of holes so it can fit a variety of sizes, I think.  There is something strange though.  In addition to the band, there were 2 tiny screws in a plastic bag and a screw driver inside the box.  I can't imagine why they are there.  Anyone else get these extras? Any idea what they're for? While this watch band looks pretty, the strap is breaking constantly. The metal piece that has tiny screws in it keeps coming apart which causes my watch to come undone throughout the day. Poor quality of hardware, even though the band itself is cute. Very disappointed since I was excited to wear it. I loved the band and the beautiful pattern. Sadly, after only wearing for not even 2 full weeks, the clasp broke and I can't wear anymore. Cute design of wristbands (I get A LOT of compliments), but EXTREMELY poor quality. I wore mine for two weeks and the strap broke (a nail fell out and then the metal bar came apart).  Save your $$!",1,1

"First off, the Ring is very cool. I really like it and many people  that come to my front door (salespeople) know what it is immediately and don't bother me. There are three problems however, one very serious (in my opinion). So this Ring Video Doorbell worked for about 4 months. I came home one day and the door bell button was stuck in the down position and the unit burned out. I contacted Ring and customer service was receptive and sent me a replacement unit. Unfortunately the replacement unit had trouble connecting to my solid wi-fi and I was directed to reboot the unit by holding down the orange button for 20 seconds. After the unit was rebooted it connected to wi-fi but would not charge or ring my mechanical door chime. My unit was hardwired to my doorbell using a 16 volt transformer and mechanical door bell and the first unit worked fine until it burned out. I spent some time on chat with customer service going through all the troubleshooting when they eventually agreed to send another replacement unit.  Writing this review the morning after it took someone about 20 seconds to disable and steal our Ring Doorbell. Camera triggered too late to get a look at the person stealing it, speaker feature hung up and didn't activate (like usual) and it was gone from my house in a shockingly short amount of time.",-1,-1
"Good length, easy for nursing. Fits tight. Nice nursing top.  Provides a good amount of privacy.  It's especially nice for the cooler seasons.  Runs large in size.  It does look a bit frumpy, but it's still a nice modest nursing top. Not the most flattering shirt. But it's functional and easy to breastfeed or pump in. Love these shirts! Great price, really nice fit and functionality. Will buy again! Fit as expected. The fit was good and material was decent but the neck line was too high and looked weird I bought this for my cousin who just gave birth. She is very pleases with the quality ,fit, and softness. Launders wonderfully. Comfortable and easy to wear and use Perfect",1,1
"This ring looks exactly as pictured. I ordered my size and its a little snug but still fits.  I picked this one because it didn't look too large or thin and the back of the band doesn't taper very much. It's sturdy. I am hoping that it lasts a long time. I just got this.  Though it is too small for the finger I intended,  I found one that it does fit on.  I wasn't too worried since I could return for free.  Ring is true to picture.  I would buy again.  I will updated this if the ring turns my finger green. I ordered a size 7 and it's true to size; measured using a ring sizer for jewelry making. I love the leaf design, the ring is beautiful and sturdy. The design width is about 0.7 cm. I've had this ring for over a year and haven't noticed any wear, nor has it discolored. Lovely and Very Detailed Design My wife likes Sterling Silver jewelry. I surprised her with this ring knowing that she will like it. Her reaction was more intense than what I had expected, like: ""Oh my, it's wonderful. Gee, that's so nice. Gosh, thank you sooo much."" She put on and hasn't taken it off. That was a week ago. Beautiful! This was exactly what I was looking for and I'm a picky shopper. Lightweight yet high quality, very feminine with nice detail. I usually wear a size 5, I saw a few reviews recommended sizing up for this ring so I ordered a 6. It fits comfortably, but a 5.5 may have been a more secure fit. It'll be a perfect substitute when I don't want to get my wedding ring dirty. Highly recommend! This ring is very pretty and is sized accurately.  It is comfortable to wear and looks great!  I don't know that it's really truly silver though.  There is something stamped in it, but it isn't very recognizable (photo attached).  I guess I'll find out how long the ring lasts.  For the price, it's a decent ring--no complaints for now! This ring is just adorable! It fit larger than I expected, so I ended up wearing it on a different finger instead. The design is so unique and it is the perfect width. The design doesn't go all the way around the ring, which is nice because it is more comfortable. I have been wearing it for a couple of days, washing my hands and doing dishes and everything with it on and it still looks great. I will update if I have any concerns later on.",1,1

"I was joking with the relative I bought it for; asked him if he thought it would clean MY toy (a touring motorcycle). Just to keep up the kidding, I applied some to a corner of a paper towel and dabbed it on road tar stuck to one of my lower wind deflectors (plexiglass and care must be taken to clean because some cleaners cloud the clear plex). Two swipes with the towel and the tar was gone with no adverse effect! I don’t intend to continue using it, but THAT is some serious cleaning! This cleaner works well. Works great and my wife has me order it when needed When I received mine, I THINK some of it leaked out and coated the container because when I was about to use it, it was a bit slippery. Not sure if it was to make sure the plastic come off easier or something. Other than that it's a great cleaner! Would recommend. like it seems to work It leaves no smell or soapy residue like dish soap, and it wipes away pretty easily.  I haven’t taken a culture test of any toys, so I can’t really confirm whether or not it’s working, but I like it ALOT better than my other options! Works great for cleaning menstrual cups and cheaper than similar products marketed for that purpose.",1,1
"fell in love with this shoes immediately when I see it.. purchase it and I don't regret at all.. it's super comfortable and there is 2 shoe laces for u to use it.. thank you lazada!!!! If you are still thinking to get this shoes, you should grab them now. The most comfortable shoes that travelled with me to SEOUL for 7 days. Bought this at a discounted price. Super worth it ! Fast delivery too . Came in the puma box and everything was just perfect. Really love it! Hi can i ask, will you be restocking the sold out sizes?",1,1
"Bought these because I loved the variety and design of these set of darts. They are even better in person. I have a digital board and the original darts that came with it either got lost or the tip broke off with time.The board is perfect and looks like new but had no darts. I saw this set and thought they looked great and for the description and the price it was a good deal. I was a 100% right. They are sturdy, heavy construction and work awesome! They even improve the appearance of the board on the wall of my Family Room. Now is a decor accent! Needed replacement darts for our electronic dart board.  These fit the bill. Well made, cute flights, but tips damage easily.  Good thing you can get extra tips. Great beginner set of darts.  I bought these for my kids so they could use the dart board in the basement and they are working quite well. Very nice dart set. Works well with my electronic Arachnid board. The darts have a nice weight/feel. Very well made. Fall apart after falling constantly have to rebuild them and the tips break too easily I would definitely buy these again. Awesome quality. Great price for what you get. The fins come off the dart easily though and are not snug, so it's worthwhile to secure them with a dab of glue or small piece of scotch tape. AAA++++AAA++++",1,1
"Just to qualify this review a bit, I am a mechanical engineer with 20+ years of experience in medical device R&D who also likes to muck around in the kitchen quite a bit. I've been frustrated with the poor craftsmanship and poor durability of ""non-stick coatings"" (that stick!) and the maintenance difficulties of seasoned steel or cast iron pans. I finally broke down, did a little research, and chose the ""Healthy Legend Deluxe 8 Pc German Weilburger Ceramic Coating Non-stick Fry Pans and Sauce Pan Cookware Set"" as my first foray into ceramics. Came across this set several months ago while searching for ceramic coated, non-stick cookware that was also induction ready.  Initially looked at Zwilling's Spirit, but decided to try the Healthy Legend, as it was about half the price.  I must say that was a pretty good decision.  Ordered the set Thursday night...received on Saturday around noon.  Handles were easy to install on the lids and on the pot & pans.  Immediately made lunch: stir-fried chicken and cabbage over brown rice.  I was pleased with the fact that I was able to cook quickly on lower heat, and with less oil, once the pan was hot.  Cleaning consisted of simply wiping with a damp dishrag.  I have had these for a couple of months now, and my only complaint concerns the handles on the glass lids: they are metal, and get hot.  I might search the local hardware stores for some type of non-conductive replacements for these metal knobs.  Still, these are a good buy for the money.  I eventually intend to get the Zwilling Spirit, but until then, these will do nicely.  I will probably get the Wok and the 7 quart stock pot, as well... My wife purchased 1 of these pans as a test unit. She liked it so well that she purchased this complete 8 piece set. They are well built and the ceramic non stick coating works well and seems to be holding up. Her only complaint is that the lids have plain metal knobs and wishes they were silicone coated to help disperse heat. The handles are all the same length which on the smaller pans make them off balance until some food is added to the pan. Not a big deal but something to be aware of. In all they are one of the better pan sets we have owned. I am completely satisfied with this cookware. I have wanted at least one pan that was non-stick but would never buy the products on the market with made with harmful materials. It is hard to believe that people bought the terrible teflon and similar cookware marketed for years in spite of the warnings about safety and the poor quality of the brands. Don't buy, food sticks unless you like to put a lot of oil in your food maybe then it migut work. Also the handles get very hot. I like the size of the pots and the shapes of it, and the glass lid only. I spent a lot of money and would have liked to return it! It was alot of money to spent on pots but I thought maybe I do not have to buy them agian for sometime and these will do the job of being non toxic and non stick but does not work!!! I could not find these pans in William-Sonoma or anywhere else.  I had read the reviews and took a leap of faith.  They are one of the best purchases I have made.  Easy to clean, non-toic, cool blue, and the perfect weight with sturdy good size handles for a good grip.  Highly recommended.  Ecellent product for the price.",1,1
"Meh... For the money, not terrible, but definitely not the best athletic panty I tried. I ordered five different styles/brands trying to find a winner. My hands down fave is the Knix Athletic Moisture Wicking Boyshort. However, the pros and cons of this pair are worth nothing. Pro- the price is reasonable and they do dry quickly. They have also washed well (lingerie bag, air dry). The fabric is rather thick, but basically soft and comfortable EXCEPT for the silicone around the leg openings. Cons- The fabric is so thick, they are hotter than my other athletic panties and don't seem to breathe as well. The silicone in these is not particularly comfortable and it is tight around around the legs. I am not a thigh gaping flamingo, but I don't really have thick thighs either. I think these could be prohibitively uncomfortable for larger thighs.These panties also do show a slight line under my running tights, and bunch up a bit around the silicone on long runs. Economic choice in an athletic panty, but not great. I have been wearing Jockey underwear for many years.  I had read the reviews that mentioned that these ran small, so I ordered just one pair in the size that I usually wear in Jockey.  I wanted to try it before I ordered more. They fit perfectly!!!  I wanted to use these panties when I exercise and I needed something that wicks moisture away because I sweat a lot.  This underwear is ideal and works exactly as I hoped that it would.  I then bought more so that I have several pairs on hand, and I will very likely buy more in the future. Smooth, no lines.  Doesn't roll or bunch up anywhere.  Love the fabric.  Hugs you without being tight.  Doesn't gap anywhere.  Will be buying the other colors!!! just right and pretty over priced though So comfortable.  They breath well.  Own several pairs. Cannot beat these underwear for fit and comfort. They are also great for travel since they dry incredibly quickly, which makes it easy to wash them along the way. Good for working 10 hour shifts Great for work out and appealing too",1,1

"Having used SSD drives for a couple years now, that is all I will use as an internal drive. I recently purchased a refurb iMac that came with the stock 3.5"" 1TB hard drive and wanted to replace it with a Samsung 840 Evo 1TB SSD. I looked around at different 2.5-to-3.5"" driver converters and noticed a lot of variation and wanted to make sure the adapter I purchased had two things: 3 stars for doing its only job, 1 more for being able to hold 2 SSD's. The 5th star can't be given, though, because the drive is about an inch longer than needed - and inside a case, an inch is a lot! If I push it forward enough to be able to plug cables into my MoBo without hassle, then it hits the front grate where my intake fan is going. In order to have it clear the fan and find the mounting holes, it sticks way out over the board and well past the end of the drive. Pros: the height, side mounting holes, and bottom mounting holes match up to a standard 3.5"" HDD. Perfect for putting a SSD into a case that had HDDs in mind. Even though this is meant for 2, using for 1 SSD works just as well. Good solid metal material. Comes with mounting screws. I got the Sabrent 3.5in to SSD 2.5in adapter for use in a Dell Optiplex mini-tower. The 3.5in hard drives are held in a screwless caddy in Dell Optiplex and Precision models. These have their handle offset to allow access the location of a 3.5in hard drive SATA interface. It is a nice solid adapter, not like the cheap thin metal or plastic ones.  The predrilled holes are in the right places and my SSD fit perfectly.  The more important thing to be aware of is how your enclosure is made.  This adapter raises the 2.5"" drive off the base by just about 1/8"".  That is great for heat dissipation.  I, however, couldn't use it in one of my enclosures because the connectors are right against the base, ready to accept a 3.5"" drive, and with the adapter, there was no room for straight (as opposed to ""L"" shaped, which I didn't have) SATA connectors on a cable.  With two other enclosures, there was no problem at all.  Those had built in ""L"" shaped SATA connectors.",1,1

"I destroyed gold and silver rings while restoring antique tools so I decided to try this one, so far, I am very pleased as the wear and scarring problem that I was experiencing is solved. It also looks like a more expensive ring. comfort fit, and scratch resistance !!! Looks exactly how I expected and fits well very heavy for its size (compared to SS or brass) Loin print to small Very nice ring. Worth every penny. I bought this product last October(2015) as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He works in construction and usually forgets to take his jewelry off. This is the only thing that I got him that has yet to break. In fact the ring is barely scratched. This product is amazing and worth every value. If you want something to last a long time and that looks great I sugguet this ring Awesome My husband loves his ring. He has had it for approximately 4 months and it still looks brand new! Not a scratch. Highly recommend!!",1,1
"My daughter loves pigs...these fit well. They have more coverage like a brief rather than bikini cut which keeps them from giving wedgies which is nice. I got the size 4 for my 3 year old daughter. She is 42"" and weighs around 42# The patterns we received were different than those pictured and different than some in another review. My daughter still loves them though. I did notice one pair was longer than the rest (pictured). Also, after putting a pair on her, I noticed that a couple pair have very little stretch in the waist, making them tighter. She is very petite and a lot of 2t clothes are still large on her. We ordered 2T/3T and the pairs that didn't have much give are pretty snug on her. These are great! My little one loves them. The fabric is soft, the designs and colors are bright and fun. I bought size 4T and they are just a little loose so she can grow into them.  She just turned 3 yo & 29lbs for size reference. Would definitely buy again. I bought these because I'm potty training my daughter I'm a few weeks and she loves Peppa pig. They are also big enough so that I could sew a cloth diaper lining I'm them like regular think training pants. As these are adorable and well worth how much they were for how many u get they have already fell apart. I’ve washed them once. Don’t think I will order them again. Very disappointed. Walmart underwear are made with the same seams don’t fall apart this quickly 😑 These are cheaply made, I ended up spending a bit more at Carter's for much better quality and comfort. I would buy these for initial potty training transition, since you won't feel bad about throwing them out when there are accidents beyond what you can wash. Love the new designs!!!  We are potty training & our little loves Peppa Pig.  Everyday she chooses the Peppa Pig underwear & tells everyone at school that she has Peppa panties.  Cracks me up.  So far these have washed well. My four year old is in love with her peppa pig panties. The images are cute and colors are bright. They fit true to size and seems comfortable for her.",1,1
"The drive performs fantastically. It truly is a successor to the 850 Evo. I purchased this drive to upgrade my laptop, and right off the bat I noticed a huge improvement. Boot to desktop was about 7 seconds. Would absolutely buy again. I bought this Samsung 860 to replace the extremely slow stock Seagate ST2000LM003 drive that came with the Dell 5759 laptop. I downloaded Samsung Data Migration to clone the disk. Samsung Data Migration was fast, but it's flawed; so don't blindly trust it or you may ended up losing your data. The hard drive in my Late 2012 iMac is starting to die. Since the hard drives in iMacs are not user accessible (at least not without major surgery), I decided to use an external drive as my boot and system drive. I bought this drive, and the HighPoint Dual-Bay Thunderbolt 10Gbps Storage Dock (RocketStor 5212) to house it. I put the drive in the HighPoint, plugged everything in, then... As at least one other reviewer has stated the Samsung Data Migration Tool has problems with cloning all partitions. In this case my recovery partition was not cloned. I ended up having to fix Windows 10 which wasn't too complicated. It's disappointing Samsung would give us such a shoddy program after paying so much for their product. As for the drive itself it's fast and provides all the usual benefits of a SSD.",-1,-1

"Actually super great quality for the price. I ended up getting two old and one silver, instead of all three colors which was super disappointing, but the quality definitely makes up for it. They're super cute. The front part doesn't stay straight, but whatever, easy fix. I absolutely love these lotus flower earrings. The colors are beautiful and they are well made. It takes a little practice because your dealing with 3 separate pieces as opposed to 2, but their so pretty while being wore. Turned my ears black!! Cute earrings.. would be nice if they had a right and left and not the same for both... but I will not be wearing these again. Only wanted them for the rose gold pair anyways. Love these but cheaply made.. Great look! Both earrings in the pair are exactly same and the back of the petal is textured so you can't turn one over so the shape of the petals are reflectively symmetrical between the left and right, but it's not a big deal. They gave me three backs with each pair, though a few of the backs are loose and they aren't all exactly the same backs, but all the pairs are still wearable. Would recommend. Very cute and I have gotten compliments. I gifted one to my sister in law and sister and they both loved it. Such a good deal, so cute, but one of them came cracked in half While I love the earrings I do not like that they are identical instead of a mirror image of each other. Normally you would want the shortest or longest petal on each ear to be closest to your neck but since they are identical when looking at your profile they are identical, if that makes sense",1,1
"Our 4-yr old is ecstatic he has boots just like Mommy and Daddy. But a note to anyone thinking you can use this as a winter boot - don't. Or at least not for any extended outdoor winter time, Its probably fine for 30 min to an hour or so. But as our son is at an outdoor-based pre-school, we noticed immediately how when the temperature dropped back down to winter below freezing temps, his feet quickly got cold in them. But for above freezing, playing in muck and slush and mud and ooze they're perfect. And the lack of a handle hole on the side is what we wanted: it gives you that few more inches of waterproofness that make all the difference in mucking about in creeks and stream edges. I wear a women's 7.5 and purchased big kids size 6 for myself to save half the cost on a pair of muck boots. They are a little on the big side, and my heels slide a bit, but this has been the case with every pair of muck boots I have ever owned and allows for thick winter socks. I do wish the shaft were more narrow, since they always gape around the top on me, but it makes it easy to tuck in pants. These boots are kinda the answer to a lot of things for a mom of a little boy. They are much easier to walk in than snowboots, and they are excellent for hikes in the hills and to waterfalls, or playing in the creek. Also awesome because they can be used for more than one season. Being as we didn't have snow this year, I wasted fifty dollars on a kid size pair of snowboots that are in pristine condition and will not fit next year. Once I discovered Muck boots, I was not hesitant to pay the orice for an all-season all-purpose boot. We live on acreage and my younger kids have always used the cheap $20 rain boots (I don’t want to buy $69 boots every year their foot gets bigger). Great boots, kids love them.  Would recommend these to anyone who has a kid that likes to slosh in mud puddles, play in the rain, and not worry about getting their feet wet, cold and messy.  We bought these for the inbetween times here in northern MN for spring and fall when a winter boot is just tooo hot, but still need a waterproof, ""muck"" proof boot, for the kids to go to school in and play in.  Best feature I think is they fit like a glove, and don't slip off like the other rubber boots out there.  We wear them during the summer on rainy days, and the kids don't complain about having hot sweaty feet either. I purchased these for my 7 year old twin granddaughters (I bought two pairs, different colors).  They ran about a full size small.  I was afraid the longer sizes would be too sloppy wide, but they were not.  As for when and how long to wear these ""winter"" boots, both girls, in party dresses, donned their new boots and took off to enjoy a 90 degree day!  The weather changes quickly in Upper Michigan, and I am positive these boots will see a lot of wear. I loved the boots and so did her mother as for my granddaughter that was another story. I got the ""I'm never wearing these they're ugly"", never knew one had to make a fashion statement while cleaning out the barn and shoveling horse poo. Her mother spent 20min or so enlightening her on barn chores and footwear before I got a thank you...kids today. Actually picked these up for my wife after we got my son a pair of the all blck ones and they fit her perfectly. She normally wears a size 8 in womens shoes and these fit like a glove and she is very happy with them",1,1
"I have been using this computer for 3 weeks and found the following: Product was as described and worked well for our needs.  Unit was smaller than we expected so that was also a plus!  Very quick and with enough storage for day-to-day home use.  Thank you. We use it for the cash register - it fits under the screen and give us an extra drawer where the Dell used to live. Now the Dell serves as the gunsmith's computer where it doesn't have to work very hard and this Acer does the heavy lifting. Great  compact pc , with it's new technology hard disc.the speed of the hard disc is much faster than the conventional one.",1,1
"My son and my daughter love's it, unfortunately the size is quite small. So, I returned it and ordered the bigger size. My son actually wears medium, I ordered large cause some reviews says to get a bigger size, still the pants is very tight and the sleeves comes short. So I ordered XL, hopefully it will fit into my son perfectly. It is a size small. i wear a 35waist and should have gotten an xxl. Great fit, good quality, very nice Nice quality,  fast shipping and runs a little small, therefore, I got one size larger and it fit just right. It fits me well. I expected a black one with 2 vents in the back, but I only received a dark gray with any vent. The jacket Didn’t have a slim fit, was slightly big but the pants were tight. Very nice suit my son is very petite so I had to have it altered good quality not cheap at all Got a size or two bigger as recommended. still little tight around chest. When you buy a slim it means slim. A pencil.",1,1

"Got one for my jeep, told hold a drink for the passenger. Found another purpose for it as well, as it's great for hanging plastic bags for take out food. It's strong, does the job and I have had no problems with mine. I have told other Jeep owners about it as well, as it's priced right and does the trick. Okay item for the price, the tightening twist screw broke off.  Fortunately it broke at the desired point so, it stays on the bike.  So, eventhough the twist scrrw broke i am using this on my motorcycle and love it.  I must confess the company that sold this followed up after reading my review willing to send me another.  I am using the one I have so I told them not necessary.  Talk about great customer service. - Revised Review - I have had this product for a short time and the clamp broke. It is plastic and when you tighten it, it fails by breaking. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Update to previous review. I have heard from the seller/manufacturer and they are making it right. They will be sending me a new cup holder once they have improved the design. The follow up os why I changed this to 5 stars. This universal holder fits around so many different sizes it's a joy.  Will never again buy any other make. These are junk.  The cam lock is plastic.  Both snapped while installing them. Works pretty well on my boat to hold drinks.  My boat only has 2 cup holders, so having this is great.  I may buy another one, but want to use this for a while to thoroughly test it first. This fit on the handlebars of my old X mark mower, allowing me to carry a small insulated cup while I work. It's great to have a cold beverage during the dog days of summer.",1,1

"This is my first ever review on Amazon.  I hope someone changes the review criteria from 'shoes' to 'shoe horn'.  Anyhow,  I love it.  It is the most beautiful shoe horn I have ever seen or used.  I have the solid stainless steel one. It is comfortable to hold; smooth and hefty.  Could never bend or break this solid shoe horn.  It is a forever item, if it is not lost, my great, great grandchildren will be using it!  While one might like a longer or shorter shoe horn, I find this one to be just right.  If one wears compression stockings, it can be used to help pry the blasted things off your feet without worrying about snagging the stocking or bending the shoe horn.  A little pricy, compared to plastic, but a lifetime purchase.  If one needs a hook on the end to manipulate objects, get something else, or get a separate dressing aide. Not ""stainless steel"" stainless metal....  maaaybe...  Clearly non-ferrous, clearly aluminum. excellent product and reasonable price - highly recommended! It is very sturdy and doesn't bend when using it but it would be better if it were a few inches longer.  My husband doesn't have great flexibility so the length is a problem for him. Best shoe horn I ever owned, solid and long enough to slide into my tennis shoes with a breeze! This is a great Shoehorn. Very nice quality and fit the had really well. This will last a long time! Exactly what I wanted to give to my father. Works great for my Dad. I was surprised at how heavy duty it is. You won't be able to bend this thing. Worth the higher cost, definitely a quality item. A+ GRADE",1,1
"My ten year old grandson wears this shirt often.  It was not just a St. Pat's Day shirt. Now my son is ready for St. Patricks day. Nice shirt, didnt shrink like some cotton shirts tend to. Color stayed after initial wash. I am happy with purchase. Nice quality shirt, fits just as we had hoped.  My son loves it! It fits pretty large (only reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  But it's a great t-shirt and of great quality.  The large sizing means we'll get 2 St. Patrick's Days out of it instead of one so I suppose that means it's a great value too:) T-shirt was just as described and company that shipped was super fast and gracious enough to write a personal thank you! Fit was perfect. Thanks. Size description perfect!  Fits my 8 year old son great.  Ready for St. Patrick's Day! Awesome color...my boys will represent St. Patrick's day😆🍀",1,1

"I bought these because I bought some at Target and loved them. They haven't lasted as long as I hoped, so I was looking to purchase more. They are the same cut, same brand, slightly different design (mine have a ribbed texture), but overall - according to the packages - they are exactly the same. But, these fit much smaller and lower than the ones I got at Target. I did, however, purchase the same ones (a package of these, but with 8 pairs in the package) at Wal-Mart, but I was hoping for them to be like the ones I like so much. Even though the package from my original pairs and these match completely, they are not the same. I ended up returning both these and the ones to Wal-Mart because they are just too small and cut lower than the ones I currently have. However, the ones at Wal-Mart and the ones here are 100% exactly the same. It's a good product, just not like the ones I have - for some reason. I absolutely love these! The only reason they lost a star is, as someone else mentioned, they are not 100% cotton. They are 50% cotton and 50% polyester. This isn't a problem to me, but the description should be more honest. Overall though, these are great; I have bought them in the past and they hold up nicely. This is the first time I have bought panties that are not 100% cotton. I am totally pleased with these. The fit is great, they are soft and do not itch. They completely cover my rear, fit snug around my legs without being too tight and rise to my belly button. So far the quality seems great. I air dry undies, so I don't know how much they shrink in the dryer, but they dry fast. The colors are very nice. i loved it's come different color white and blue and decorated with floral  and  It is a very comfortable 100% cotton, and  he wrote in the description 50% cotton  but I am very happy now states 100% cotton on the description, well its not, this product is 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Very misleading. Please change the description immediately. They are just alittle thinner material, but they'll do. I feel they could wear out easily. I prefer the new breathables by them that are out on the market now.  Those fit well and really works better for me when working out and are Very comfortable all day long.  No riding up! Though these are the basic, run-of-the-mill, multi-pack underwear, I was actually quite impressed with them.  I am certainly not a size small and tend to have an issue with the waistband sometimes tearing away from the garment in this type of underwear.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with these.  I've already worn a few pairs from the pack and the quality seems good.  Also the type of fabric used seems to be consistent throughout the different colors.  I would, and probably will, purchase these again. Very comfortable underwear and a very good fit. These however are 50% cotton and 50% polyester",1,1

"Very strong magnet. Basically, they give you a metal sheet that you put in your phone case that you use to magnet-stick it to this mount on your car. I ordered this product for myself because I saw a more expensive brand of the same product in my friend's car and I thought that it was a clever and cheap option to display my iPhone 6s Plus in any car. After owning it for two weeks, I have come to love the simplistic concept and convenience. All I need to do is drop my phone on my vent and go. The magnet is very strong and the metal card isn't even noticeable. I love it so far, but there are a few things I have to say about the WizGear magnetic mount after a couple weeks of using it: I am in LOVE. The circular magnets fit on top of a PopSocket perfectly. I purchased a plain black one, stuck the magnet to it, and then decorated it with gel nail polish (see picture). My husband simply placed the rectangular magnet inside his case. It works amazingly and about its performance I have no complaints! It does the job right.",1,1
"Good quality as usual, classic design. Very fast one day delivery because of live up membership. Bought my 2nd pair of Sperry on Lazada and compared them with the one I have.

Great quality boat shoes As usual, quality products from Sperry everything about the shoes is authentic and feels good when worn",1,1
"Came quick.  Good fit.  As described.  Love It. It contains all the jewels and the size is about right, order a size up.  Protects the boys well :) Very smooth and comfortable pair of briefs. They fit perfectly and are very well made. They are perfect for the gym, or the bedroom. The pouch is a perfect size and holds the entire package without being too tight. The back is sheer and breathable. A very comfortable pair. You can't go wrong. Hey even 45yr olds can look good with these on ! My wife loves them on me ! Real hot & sexy she said & looks good with a nice tan also ! Want to send a pic with them on !! I'm in love with these.... First arrived EARLY ahead of schedule delivery...... I wear 34-35 USA size , ordered xl and it's perfect!!!  I will search for other colors!!!  ' usually wear a medium for 33/34 waist but based on reviews went a size up to a large. fits well, i like the pouch and the see through. Design wise the over lay across the pouch is different but not a spoiler I normally wear a small for a 29"" waist and the medium fit me perfectly. I really like the soft fabric and the mesh is soft as well. I bought these for my beau and they are dang sexy. Apparently breezy in back with warmth up front, he wore them all day and night and found them just comfortable. He ordered himself more! My waist is a 34 and XL fits me perfectly. This underwear feels comfortable and makes me look and feel sexy. The mesh is comfortable and does not cause itchiness and the pouch is made of a soft material",1,1
"My husband chose these and although the review isn't coming from him I will say the color selection is great, but for some reason the silicon irritated his skin; he used multiple ones to see if the same issue occurred and every time he would let his skin heal and try a new one after 3 tries he knew it was the silicon. He's used other silicon rings with no irritation issue so I'm not sure what's so different that he can't use these. Unfortunately, now he have a bunch of rings that he can't use. These rings are perfect! I loved.I can wear them for any sports and don't need to take it off like I did when wearing my wedding ring! It protects my fingers in the course of fitness to avoid injury. Great fit, very comfortable and light weight.They are really perfect rings, I highly recommend them. I doubt the quality of this 10-pack ring set because of the very inexpensive price. However, when I received the rings I was very surprised that not only ten different colors of ring, but also the quality was very good. These rings are very soft and comfortable to wear on. Wearing different colors every day is a very interesting thing. What a good purchase. I like the rings . I change them out all the time like I change my clothes blue shirt blue ring  fast delivery great price.most importantly safety you don’t have to worry about your ring getting hooked on something and ripping your finger off. I have recommended these to friends. Came fast, good quality.  The do tend to stretch out a little, not enough to change the size in my opinion.  If I had it to do over again, I would go a little narrower I think.  Overall though, these are nice. Great for men with large knuckles preventing metal ring s to be properly sized.  Hubby likes changing his colors daily too.  Comfortable for working in I love these rings! They are very comfortable to wear, the colors are spot on, and would highly recommend them to everyone. They were a little thiner than I thought they would be, but for 10$ you can't beat them. They fit good, and the colors are just like the pictures.",1,1
"Really like this set rings so much definitely worth the money as it comes 13 pieces in a set, had 13 different cute designs, loves the color tone it can be mix and match, comes with different sizes on every design, everyday change different rings depending on what I'm wearing, will definitely recommend this to a friend. I bought these rings because I have never wore knucle rings before, I wear a size 7 and these are small I guess I have big fingers lol. So I'm giving these to my nice she will be able to wear them. Very pretty designs and very strong which surprised me for the price. I have bigger fingers so they barely reach my knuckles but they would be perfect for someone with small hands or teens. These are some really pretty rings. They look exactly the way they are in the picture. I believe these are size 5-6. The designs on the ring are also pretty. These fashionable rings will go well with anything you wear. They remind me of james avery rings. The ring with the hand design, i believe that ring is size 4 or 4 ½. Unfortunately these rings are to big for me so ill be giving these are a gift to a friend. She will love these. Glad i got these. Get what you pay for. The rings are not a smooth cut, some even have sharp bits on them. One is chipped. They are also large, only about two of the rings actually fit my fingers but it fits very loosely. I believe my ring size is a 6 if that helps.. These rings are so cheap. They came to me and one was so bent it wouldn't go on a finger. The gems were also not glued on properly. Additionally, they turned my fingers green. Some of the rings are really cute, but they came in generally the same size and only fit on my thumb, pointer, and middle fingers. My middle finger is size 7.5. Small but pretty rings. Yes they are smaller than usual rings because they are supposed to be. Fun designs and lightweight feel. The rings have different styles, I really love this set of rings, because I can use different ring for different situations, and it is also suitable for take the whole ring set on hand. Love it!",1,1
"Looks exactly like the picture. Note that this tie is likely thicker than any other tie you own - you're probably not going to get a double windsor with this one. Also, you'll want to keep a lint roller handy the first time you wear this - it sheds little wool fibers that show up on a white shirt. Still, this is an awesome tie for the price, and I'll likely buy all of the colors eventually. This is a great quality tie that is very thick and soft. The colors match the online description perfectly. Nice tie.  My 24 yr. old son likes his. Looks a bit darker than picture It is skinny wool tie, thicker than bought in market, it took a few extra min to tie a nice knot, perfect tie for the winter. much thicker material than most ties, but it makes a nice knot. the cashmere fabric is very soft！ Fabric and production feel on the skimped side.",1,1

"These have a break-away flap with a built-in C-ring...what else could you ask for? These are so cool! If you're reading this then the pictures are within the guidelines.  I had to move quick after getting this completely on.  As has been stated, the pouch is small.  Over all I love this.  I bought it was the lift and support, which I need.  I mostly wear it without the pouch. Just slightly smaller than I expected but fit well, well made and fast shipping, Ordered Jan 5, received 14th, that's fast from China. Thank you. OMG, sexy as all get out!  I had ordered two pair just different colors both pair fit  as Expected. Ordered a large, same as I would normally and were a  bit snug but didn't care one bit cause they look so good! One thing to take into consideration is the front pouch that snaps open/closed....not The only negative is that they’re so small. I ordered an XL and have a 34 waist. They barely fit me, and the pouch is not usable at all. (not even close) Thats ok I didnt plan on using the pouch base on the other reviews. Hand wash for sure as they will be unwearable if they shrink. They do feel sexy to wear though, just wish they were a bit larger. I wear a large (33""-34"" waist). So I purchased an Extra Large in this style. Still too small.  This size ""might"" pass for a USA medium. If you have larger than average genitalia, you may want to just skip this style altogether. The pouch for the XL size is not large enough to accommodate anything larger than average or smaller than average.",1,1

"I don't wear hats, myself, but I got this for my grandson.  He is very pleased with the hat. Nice hat Great product. Hat feels good, no low quality. Stitching job is amazing. Really vibrant colors and pops out. Adjustable, so it would fit everyone. Definitely recommend to buy. (Especially to you Kanye fans!) They even gave a Saint Pablo Pin for free! Thank you!! This hat is great. The adjustable strap helps to get the fit just right, and the stitching of the logo is perfect (no loose threads). It also comes with a Saint Pablo button which I didn't really care for but it was a nice gesture.",1,1
"Love this container. I am using it for my crafting and I can see everything I have placed or crammed into this holder. Great product, great find, great price. Very sturdy and roomy, made with strong acrylic that can withstand rough handling. Perfect for intended use or other project ideas like makeup holder. Use your imagination and you can carry your items in this holder. My 9 year old loves to work on projects. Normally I find pens, pencils, scissors, etc all over the house, not in one location. And he usually has multiples of the same things because he misplaces and can't not find. This little carrier has contained his things. The cart is found all over the house, but the contents aren't spread out. I use this as a portable office and it has a spot for stapler white-out, post-its pens, stamps etc. I really like it. 4.3 star because of the handle, it's thin for the amount of weight you may be carrying, be careful to pick up tote straight up , don't twist or be too rough with handle or it could crack, I feel. Otherwise , great product. Would be good for make-up items too. This is a great organizer. I'm using it on top of my childrens' art cart for scissors, colored pencils, sheets of stickers and some odds and ends. It is crystal clear. It came with a sticker affixed but it came off easily with no residue which is a huge plus. I highly recommend this. Love this!!! It’s nice and big which I wanted. I can store all my sons pens,, markers, crayons, colored pencils, gel pens , etc. super hard plastic so I know this will last! This tote is perfect for my art supplies. Lots of different compartments of various sizes so I can fit just about anything in it. The handle makes moving it from room to room easy and convenient. A great product I filled this to the brim with markers, fine liners, gel pens.All my pens are easily available. Thinking about another one. Great for coloring.  I have tons of pens and markers and pencils and it fits it all.",1,1
"I love this retro watch - this was a gift to my significant other on a special day and he loved it to bits. The watch comes in a lovely box - the watch is visible in the transparent window on the box. The watch has heft, which adds to the character. The chain is made of good metal and looks very strong. The opening mechanism (to open the watch) is robust - my partner has been using it about once every 30 minutes and it has worked well. The face of the watch is easy to read (which is very important). Overall very pleased with this purchase. This is a very bad product. I didn't expect much going into it due to how cheap it is, however my expectations were lowered even further. The package came with a lot of bubble wrap, yet the back of the somehow got broken and won't stay on. It doesn't come with instructions on how to adjust the time for the watch, and while trying to figure out how to adjust it the contents of the watch came falling out of the back. People, use your $8 on something much better than this, or save up to get a higher quality pocket watch. Very cheap. BUT it was inexpensive. I was going to return but my youngest son loved the face style. Made him happy therefore I am happy. This is SO good looking and it is high quality.  LOVE IT! As expected. Nice and excellent quality This watch is very easy to wear. Light, and not very bulky. It's nothing special, but still looks great! I'd say it's a great buy for anyone making a costume, just looking for that old time look without breaking the bank. only used one day, and have no complaints, can't wear a watch so I needed something at work to keep track of time and this has been my answer or so I'm hoping, I don't have to have it on my body I can hand it one my cart,",1,1
"First time using this product.  Was impressed by the claim and tested out the pad.  There is much lesser odour observed after my dog leave her waste on the pad.  It works and am happy with the result Was a faithful customer due to efficiency and fast delivery.. however prices has increased and sadly will be buying from elsewhere for a more economical pricing of diff brands as i use peepads constantly/change daily for my pets.

"I purchased one of the Precision Stainless Steel pans from the grocery store, but it had the Thermospot markings. I loved it, so I decided to purchase this set. I could tell this set didn't have the Thermospot and I'm not really sure what that does, so I didn't care that these were different. Do not buy! After using these pans for less than six months, the non-stick coating simply does not work! They were amazing at first, but over time the non-stick surface has discolored and EVERYTHING sticks to the pans now.  I followed all of the manufacturer's guidelines for use and care; these pans are simply poorly made and not meant for someone who uses them daily. <BEWARE> I've been using these pans for over a year now on my induction cook-top and they are great. They heat very evenly, and never ""sing"" on the burner like some other pans I have . I put the stainless steel saucepans in the dishwasher regularly and they come out great. I hand wash the non-stick ceramic fry/saute pans to extend the non-stick qualities, but it's not a chore. They practically wipe clean with a paper towel, even from burnt on eggs.  I definitely recommend these pans. Worst pans EVER. After using them for 2 weeks everything started to stick to the pans. Everything. I regret buying these. It's a pain in the ass to return them and they are truly horrible I replaced my old cookware for this set. So beautiful with good craftsmanship. Worth the price. I love the frying pan. It is large and heats so quickly. I've used it two weeks. Easy wash. As of now, love 'em.  Very solid cookware.  Time will tell.  If there are issues that develop, I'll be back. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It seems to be high quality, the only thing we were surprised about is that not all the pans were ceramic. This could have been better explained. She said they cook fine, but as usual with chrome, there is sticking if you aren't heat conscious.",1,1
"I wear an xxl t shirt, and the xxl jacket fits perfect. Great protection. I was grinding steel for a few hours yesterday purposely hitting the jacket with the sparks, and it still looks new. Not a whole to be found. There are only 4 snap buttons, so its easy to remove with thick welding gloves. Breast pocket is on the inside of the jacket to avoid the ""hot pocket"". My welder husband loves this!  Fits good - true to size 2xl, lightweight so he doesn't overheat when it's hot temp weather - but still is well protected.  He uses it for real deal commercial welding jobs -- not light hobby welding.  Washed and dried and still going strong.  Price is right so good value.  Would recommend and will buy again when needed. I have heavy leather weld jackets, costing a LOT more. But I cannot deal with the restricted movement and heavy weight, and did mention HOT in Hawaii. This has become the SHOP jacket not just the weld jacket. As a machinest I ruin a LOT of clothes, so far this is working out fine. Light, cool, slips on and off easy. Good jacket, I use it wile welding, grinding and sanding. I used it welding under my car, no problem My boyfriend wears an XL shirt and a XXL fit perfectly. He wore it only twice. He owns an auto shop and welds on a daily basis. The first time it worked perfectly. The jacket kept all the sparks from coming through the material. The next day he used it again and he came home with a bunch of burn marks all over his arms. Fits great. Fabric feels a little stiff but after I have it on and begin working, I don't notice.  I feel well protected in it as well. great choice for a welder woman Hubby loved it!  No more burnt arms.",1,1

"love it ! I wear them all the time and they were cheap and I was afraid they would be cheap made and fall apparat but they hold up super well !! super cute I love them, I get complements on them all the time and people think there nice well made. I have sensitive ears and normally can only wear silver or gold, but these aren't and they don't irritate my ears !  I wore them to a dance and they go with everything !! there so great , I love being able to find cheap but well held up jewelry . I hope that if you buy this product you have the same luck as I had with them ! These earrings are very cute however the weight of the earrings are too heavy and the backing does not hold them into your ear. They constantly fell out. I used a different backing but still had issues with the weight. If you have sensitivity to earrings these are not for you. My ear lobes were very sore and I only wore them at a wedding for 2 hours. came super fast and are pretty similar to what the post is for! I got these as earrings for my bridesmaids. Super cheap when you are buying food 6 girls :) LOVED them! Fell apart before i got it and it bent like paper. not even worth me spending time to send it back but i am just getting around to write reviews on everything. poor poor poor quality Beautiful but definitely large and a bit heavy love these These are really beautiful but bigger than I thought. Still cute but since they are big I need support stickers because they sag. No problem. not bad, very nice.",1,1
"Didn’t volumize my hair, in fact my hair went flatter faster when using this. It does give a nice shine to hair without being greasy and gave my hair a certain bounce, but not for long. I could probably find a cheaper shampoo and conditioner that does the same thing. Also smells nice. Not volumizing at all, hair feels really dry after My daughter loves the product: the great lather, makes her hair soft and smooth, smells nice. Actually works. I like shampoo, the conditioner gave good shine but left my hair limp. I tried using less but I don't love it. As promised",1,1
"I don't normally leave reviews but I wanted to document my experience searching for quality lenses on Amazon for a discounted price. I bought 10 sunglasses between $6-$18 and ended up only keeping 3. I was looking specifically for Polarized, UVA/UVB blocking, decently reviewed, sleek shades under $20. No apparent downsides so far. They seem sturdy, look nice, are functional, and they come with a nice pouch. The hinges were too tight out of the box, but I loosened the tiny screws with a knife and it's perfect now. You CAN see your eyes through the lenses a bit on the Tortoise shell color option, but I don't mind. They're also big enough to accommodate a decently sized head. They're not the best glasses I've ever used, but for $7 you can't go wrong. Update: lens started popping out of lens within 5 days of use. Do NOT recommend. If you want polarized lenses while retaining the 80s retro feel at an affordable price, this is the sunglasses to get. After losing one more pair of $150 shades (spy optic discord), i needed to find another option. I figured these are practically disposable at the price and they look similar to my recent loss. These sunglasses are absolutely amazing!. I had purchased them in the amber hi/def color. I have multiple pair of higher end sunglasses and these surpass them all! The clarity is so impressive! I tend to have a lot of trouble with ""white"" light and these take away that sensitivity completely.  Would definitely recommend these to everyone. And to top it off they are super stylish!! Now I don't have to worry about my kids breaking them as they were like 12 bucks on Prime. Great Product! Please click that this review was helpful if it assisted in your decision:) THANKS!!",1,1

"Bought this belt for my father as it had good reviews and he was looking for one that would make it through regular wear. Less than two months after receiving, the belt is already falling apart at the notch where he normally wears it. I suppose you get what you pay for but this was disappointing and I would not purchase another. After 2 months of average wear, has separated and become unusable.  Within the first week could see top layer cracking. Purchased to replace a full leather belt I wore for 7 years that finally broke. After just a couple dozen uses, the fabric backing separated from the ""leather"" leaving behind a gooey, sticky residue. The fabric neither sticks to the belt nor comes cleanly off. It's trash. Shortest lasting belt I've ever owned. I don't shop for belts much, I'm size 36 waist and so I ordered size 36 belt.lol.  I say 4 sizes too small, delivery was fast, belt is nice.  But I just don't want to deal with returning it.  Probably cheaper just to get another one. i buy these as dog toys. bigger sizes, then i cut them up. the strong curl created a fun shape for each dog, though they seem to to come apart easily. no, they don't ingest them, though i worry about the tanning process even for chewing. altogether the cheapest genuine leather belt i could find in a taft size on amazon ;) The belt worn too fast. I tougth: wolverine=durability. I was wrong, at least with this belt. I had a Velez reversible belt that I used almost everysingle day for 5 years!!! That was a quality belt. This one was cheap. Loved it. Worn the belt twice and not even very tight and the fake leather shiny coating is peeling off by the belt holes. Should have boat a better brand. I've had wolverine boots and they are decent quality. Not these..",1,1

"These didn't work on my car chargers. They slow charge on the outlet chargers. Not a good product. Does not fast charge! These chargers are trash. I have a Samsung Galaxy 8 and I bought these since my home was broken into and the original charger was among the items stolen. It is not compatible with any Samsung cellphone in Paraguay. The conector is very big and oval. It does NOT fast charge cable. Its a slow cable. It was taking 4:19 hours to charge from 27% to 100% with this charger (See attached picture). On the other hand I plugged the cable that came with my S8 box and it was fast charging with a time of 1:17 hours for full charge from 27% to 100%. Don't get fooled when the seller calls it OEM. The white cables do not fit a s8. The picture shows the correct cord, but what I received is not. When I go to return the item it says item is ineligible to be returned but won't give me a reason as to why. The picture I've attached shows my standard issue cord vs the white cord I received This cable damaged my charge port on my new Samsung S8+. Part of the connection system broke off in my phone and ruined 2 of the charge pins. This is not an OEM product,  it is an off brand crappy charger.  Neither cord will charge our phones regardless of the charge plug we connect it to.  The phones will not even acknowledge that the cords are plugged in.  Total waste of money.",-1,-1
This is a very nice looking watch . My wife says it's awesome and share likes the Eiffel tower fob . It fits great . This was a gift to my sister and she loves it. The rose gold color is beautiful. Charm feel off within two day.  The band is kind of hard to get off as it hangs up on the holes and there is a small metal band that the extra part of the band slides into and that always comes undone leaving that extra part of the band hanging.  I still wear it.  It's cure and the time stay right on.  Just have to put up with the band issues. Very nice for the price. Works great This watch is absolutely stunning. So glad I chose to wait a bit for it to arrive. Its beautuful. I love it My wife loves the watch it's just that little design just doest stay on. But other than that she loves it,1,1
"This is a good, solid sneaker with velcro tabs rather than laces.  The only issue I have with it is that both right and left shoes fasten in the same direction, from right to left.  I'm accustomed to velcro fasteners that fasten from the inside out.  So this took some getting used to for this senior citizen. My feet tend to swell when I sleep, and therefore to be ""EXTRA-wide when I first put on my shoes. These allow me to open the shoe VERY wide and get my feet in. Then, after walking around a bit, my feet get smaller, and a few quick tugs on the straps snug them right up. Ultimately, they wind up being a little TOO large, so if I know I'm going to be walking a LOT in the course of a day, I'll bring a gel-insert or a second pair of socks to make the final size adjustment. That is a bit inconvenient, but not the fault of the shoes. My elderly father in law loved them.  So easy for him to get them on with the 2 strap system. One did fit a bit tighter than the other but maybe his foot was a tad swollen. Only very slightly too small.  Otherwise a nice, good looking, comfortable walker that is holding up very well.  Very good no-slip sole.  Very competitive pricing. This wide width is really about normal not wide.  I have shoe stretchers which fixed the problem.  Very good foot support.  Feet don't hurt about hours in these. My 83yo Dad loves them but refuses to wear them for the intended purpose of the garden because he says they feel too good! These were for my dad who is diabetic. So it was imperative that the toebox be bigger. These fit the bill and he loves walking in these comfy shoes. The hook and loop straps need to be longer. The shoe it's self is manufactured very well and I expect to get good service out of the pair. ty",1,1

"The product is fine. The problem is with flex fit. This is the second all black Hurley hat I've purchased.  My first one I wore for at least 5 years and am still wearing it.  Very good quality and looks great with anything. Husband loves the hat. Second one. Dogs 🐕 got the first one but he wanted the exact same one. Well made and holding up great. 👍🏼 Love this hat, got a small/medium and it fits perfectly with the flexfit. Definitely my new favorite hat, better then my New Era hats. Would recommend this hat to anyone that it looking for a flexfit with high quality. This is my second Hurley black on black hat.  I loved my first one so much it's no longer black but grey.  This one I just received has a ball of wax/stitching right in the center of the bill, making a large red welt every time I wear it. I've tried cutting it out, no good. I tried placing cotton in there, no good.  So now I only wear it when I need a solid black hat for very short periods of time.  Too bad, bc my original was my all time favorite hat. This hat fits my peanut head perfect. I got the s/m. Fitted hats are usually 7 1/8. Puerto Rico has a subdued plaid look to it. Second time with this hat and its as good as the first. ""Rust"" showing up on the in side is dye bleeding. How do you not know that? I love the flex fit hats. They work great with my big head. Great quality and fitting",1,1

"Worked great and got the job done. Transferred files quickly for the epic upgrade to an SSD drive for my laptop. Like most everyone says that is the best upgrade you can do. Only other thing that compares is a RAM upgrade only if you are constantly maxing out your RAM and forcing disk writes. Between the two I would go SSD first. I will probably use this cable a several times in the next few years so if it still works my review will remain 5 stars! I have never had an issue with this product and would highly recommend it to others as in the past i have had other similar products that brake due to poor construction but never with this product 100% of the time it never has let me down thanks iCreatin keep up the outstanding work This is great.  Works lime a charm for formatting, mirroring, and pulling files.  Cable lenght might be an issue if you USB3 & USB2 are not on the same side of our laptop. OK. Can use it with SSD can't use it with HD. Just like everyone else said, it works perfectly!  A great product.... Works great!  I haven't tested data transfer rates but it seems pretty quick for what it is.  Not a single problem with this product. Worked for about a week, then nothing. Dissapointed. Works perfectly pretty I used to to copy a 30gb folder from the hard drive that I salvaged from my broken laptop. It was able to write the folder to my new computer minutes.

"I take one tablespoon of the apple cider vinegar in a glass of water in the morning.  This has been very helpful in controlling my acid re flux issues. I am using it three times a day mixing it with hot sugar free tea and a small amount of honey. It has numerous health benefits. One benefit is it reduces leg cramps and getting rid of the pain in both legs I would often have before rising in the mornings This product is not as advertised. It has obviously been filtered, no sign of ""the mother."" Also the bottle is plastic rather than glass. I will stick with Bragg's henceforth. Read the benefits of Vinegar with Mother on WebMD and decided to give it a try. Love the taste and it's good for you especially if you have Acid Reflux. We really like this vinegar.  It is actually a little milder than the normal bottle we buy which is a good thing for me.  It blends well in our homemade dressings and tastes good.  I normally take one tablespoon of ACV diluted in water to help dissolve gallstones.  I have drunk 1/2 cup of straight apple cider vinegar when I've had a gallbladder attack and just the smell of it brings back an unpleasant memory.  Having a vinegar that is not so potent (both in smell and flavor) is a benefit to me.  This is much better to drink - and cook with.  If you are used to a strong flavor or prefer more potency like other vinegars with ""the mother"" then this will seem a little weak.  But for me, it is just perfect.  Let me clarify, it is NOT weak (it includes 'the mother'), it is just not as strong in flavor and smell like others.  Works for me, it has all the right elements I need. Simple: I have been diabetic for 57 years. This is the first supplement that exceeded the hype. IMMEDIATELY! Reduced blood sugar spikes and insulin requirement. I have great hope for weight lost, indications are very good, time will tell. This APPLE CIDER VINEGAR with 'MOTHER' still inside - giving it the ""milky"" appearance instead of clear, like ""normal"" vinegar, is AMAZING STUFF. I keep some in a special VINEGAR FOOF SPRAYER to mist over a multitude of foods. tastes ok, but when I shook the bottle (required for blending) it splashed out from under the cap. I solved the problem by shaking it horizontally while holding the cap and this works.I think I was dissatisfied because the last brand I bought had a molded bottle with a deeper cap and an indentation for gripping on the side of the bottle.  The company did contact me, which was nice.",1,1
"I am very allergic to really anything but gold and also this ring. If you are sensitive to metals then I do suggest this ring. I almost never take it off and my skin hasn't turned green or broken out and the ring hasn't faded its color or shine in anyways. This is exactly what I was looking for. I needed a ring to wear in place of my wedding ring that is pretty but has no stones to worry about. It is narrow but thick/sturdy and nicely polished and shiny. Sizewise I think it runs a tad big. I normally wear 4 3/4 so ordered both 4 1/2 and 5. I'll be keeping the 4 1/2. It is comfortable but probably not as comfortable as a smooth band - but I love the design. I bought this ring to wear as a wedding band during my weight loss journey and delay resizing my actual wedding ring.  It is lovely!  It is very feminine and comfortable despite the ornate design around the edges.  The price is fantastic, too.  Lots of compliments at Thanksgiving with this ring. Recommended. Very cute ring. Got it for a thumb ring, and it is perfect. Delicate, yet sturdy. Well made, thicker than I expected, nice comfortable ring love this ring, wear it everyday instead of my ""real"" ring.  very lightweight - and after weeks of wear it still looks the same. Love it!  It's perfect. Fits great looks lovely! It's my favorite ring out of all the rings I purchased! I wear it on my middle finger with the small band I purchased on my ring finger.  Just what I wanted!

"This is a very nice looking faucet and works as expected. We bought this to match our new kitchen sink which has the same finish from the same company. Giving it 4 stars only because for the price, the finish was just a smidgen less shiny as the kitchen sink which is somewhat noticeable, and I feel the spout could have been just an inch or two taller. Using this faucet with an under-sink Aquapure filter. Both were pricy, but worth it. I'm very happy with the combination. Its one of the best features in our kitchen. super high quality faucet.  i like the fact that it's not high profile arch so it looks elegant & simple. Very good product! Works fine except that the water doesn't stop coming out immediately after turning the lever off. Usually, the water keep running for 2 seconds with gradually loosing pressure. Made with good material,  look very nice, easy to install. I use as my second faucet exclusively to filtered water. I attached to my whirlpool under sink filter. Works great for my filtered water. Please note that the model I received is not made for the Zuvo water filter, as it only had one ""tube"" input (the Zuvo models have 3 tubes).  But this is acutally better since I plan on using it with a 3M filter system.",1,1

"I can't believe I paid this much money for these, but they DO work. I had seen a few reviews that people had issues with these.  Sure enough, after ensuring my single kayak paddle was tightly mounted, it flew off my car today going 55 MPH on the highway.  Both multimounts failed- you would think at least one would have held.  I was testing it after returning home and noticed that when I put the strap in I can pull it through with a small amount of force.  I've only had these for a month.  When I first used these a month ago I remember testing them (pulling hard on the ribbon) and they seemed to hold fine, so they have structurally weakened after being on my roof for just a month.  I think the spring mechanism is too weak so there isn't enough grip now.  Fortunately amazon accepts returns and my paddle survived. Works great for hauling my greenland paddle.  Straps plenty long.  Will probably shorten them for my use.  Easy to use and perfect for my paddle. The mounts work great. I use them to carry fishing poles, pvc, oars, etc. only drawback is that they don't lock in any way to your car or cargo. this is by far one of the best products purchased in the past year. works great, purchased to hold down my pvc pipe for fly rod. I've used this for ski poles, paddles, and 2x4s and it works well.  The strap is pretty long so sometimes I have to wrap the object to keep the strap short enough so it doesn't flap on the roof.  I have a 2013 4runner with factory bars and this works well with he Yakima universal horizontal mount.  Great product. The instruction were clear. It only took a couple of minutes to install on the rack. They worked great. It took less than a minute to tie down three poles to the rack.  Also simple to take off after using maybe two minutes. These are great. Just wish there was a way of locking them to the crossbars.",1,1

"very good glasses with polarized lens, i got 2 of them the brown and the black, i find it hard to find sunglasses, because most of the times the frame is small. I get compliments on these glasses wherever I go! They're lightweight but feel sturdy, and a really cool design. I'm glad they came with a case to protect them from scratches when I'm not wearing them. I got these for my wife. She loves them, so I ordered another pair for a spare. She had a $750.00 pair of Coach sun glasses that she wore for years; these are better looking than those were and the tint is perfect. I wish I could give a 6 star. I'm not really into name brands but I've always been kind of a sucker for Ray Bans. The Ray Ban version of this club master style were too smal and they looked funny. These are very cute and unisex. They're not too big and not too small.  So happy about the price, also! -top half rim of the lenses is black, gold for the bottom half Lets be real here. These will never compare to designer brand clubmaster style sunglasses. Everyone should know this. Set your expectations people. for $9.99 what you'll get is a decent pair of style-knock off sunglasses. it came with a soft bag and a cloth wipe. the build quality is decent for plastic frames. the lens i have no complaints about either. overall good job, jooopin. These are by far my favorite pair of sunglasses I've ever owned (and I've owned a lot because hey, I'm clumsy and break most of them). They fit perfectly, are comfortable and shield my eyes from the sun. I've gotten tons of compliments on them and the price can't be beat. They are super easy to clean and even come with a cloth wipe. They don't look cheap either, these sunglasses honestly look and feel like they're good quality made. Very nice I love it",1,1
"This was the first time I've purchased this shampoo and conditioner, and I love it! I had my hair cut and colored the end of November and my hair looks just as good as the day I had it done. The scent is absolutely phenomenal. It leaves your hair feeling soft and smooth with a clean smell that last a few days. If you have highlights you need this. Totally erases and prevents any brasssiness, PLUS, my hair is super soft, tangle free and manageable. I’ve noticed the that the product changed. It used to be purple but now it’s yellow. I have used it for a few times and I like the results so far it doesn’t make my hair purple and it takes away the yellowness Smells great and works really well.

"* Yummy, Organically Delicious. Freeze Dried Yogurt And Freeze Dried Fruit Snacks. Delicious. Healthy. Okay, just a warning, but I am 18 years old. I am not a mother. I did not buy this for a child.

Baby freeze dried foods are much better snacks than most adult snacks: much less sweet or salted and full of flavor and nutrition. love these!  been using since my baby was 5 months old--we broke them in half at first, but now she puts several in her mouth at a time.  i love that they dissolve, making them less of a choking hazard (though i'd caution that you should still watch babies carefully as they eat them as they're about the size of a baby's airway and could theoretically cause choking if they went in at the right angle).  we've tried all the flavors, and she loves them all! No idea what they’re like. Package came 2/7/2018 and expires 2/10/2018, so I’ll be sending them back since I had bought a bunch and they are about to expire. Bought this for my son, he loves them. Texture is smooth and they easily dissolve. I have tried all comparable brands (cheaper) and they are nothing like these as far as flavor payout, texture and disolvability.",1,1
Quality material and fit as expected . I made new friends and was able to form an entourage with this shirt. Shirt is soft with a weathered red color; is a nice weight and the graphic is well done. Was a hit for a single guy's birthday present - he put it on on the spot. Very pleased with the  quality of this T shirt.  The color is great and washed up beautifully. I will definitely recommend friends to order and also very fast delivery! Very nice shirt. Great price. Made for a very nice gift Item exactly as advertised. awesome shirt and fits perfect.  Already had a lot of fun with the friends! Nice shirt. It's a gift so haven't washed it yet. I think she'll love it. Hope it fits. Good fit and looks great.,1,1
"This lunch bag is the perfect size. the handle is comfortable to hold. the fabric is thick and very cute. perfect to use for work or packing when u have a long day. This is the perfect lunch bag! Not bulky or heavy, nice design, insulated and easy to carry. I can fit a normal-sized lunch container, along with some cut veggies, yogurt and a drink. The pocket in front is great for utensils and napkins. Also great for meal or snacks on a day trip! I ordered this to make taking food with me more convenient. Nice sized bag and good quality. Has an outside pocket too. I love how well this is insulated. It keeps my lunch chilled throughout the morning and I can still have a cool drink with my lunch. Very well made, it will last me a long time. Great for typical lunch. A water bottle, sandwich, and a treat all fit nicely in this bag. It's smart looking and well-made. Cute bag and works great! Love it So cute! It's a little small but fits everything I need to take to work!",1,1
"This is my second pair of Tesla running shoes. The newer variant of the model compared to the last one. Still a great pair to run with! I like the newer design much better also! Also still lightweight! So it doesn't feel like you are running with bricks on your feet. Yet they also offer great cushion to absorb a lot of the shock from running. First of all, I'm used to running in $75-$125 running shoes from the likes of Asics and Saucony. I wanted to see if I could find something I'd like at a more reasonable price point. These had decent reviews at a great price, so I thought I'd give them a shot. I did my first (2.5 mile) run in these (TF-X700) shoes tonight, and I'm very impressed! They are very comfortable, super light weight, and I was impressed with the cushion feel! They also fit me very well with my chosen size. For the price, I was actually pretty surprised. I'm in the military and I have to run a lot, so I went through many different running shoes. I wanted something that wasn't so pricey since I tend to beat up my shoes pretty easily when I workout and exercise, but wow these have been doing quite well and feel great. Wow these shoes are great!",1,1

"Well, have been looking for women boxer style undies that are not nylon and do not cost an arm and a leg! I found these all the way from Turkey with the shipping cost more than the product cost! Sensible? Oh yea if you want reasonable quality and comfort where you don't have trouble with elastics digging in you and causing constant discomfort especially in the hot seasons! I looked at the size chart next to SIZE and also at the questions answered by seller and got a little confused! I am normally size 12, sometimes can get size 14 depending on manufacturers. I am 36"" waist and 44"" hip and that is comfortable without being tight. I paid much attention by reading all reviews and scanning the sizes, reason? Shipping cost to return or not return! I was ordering 5 pairs (each has a couple of legs, right?). I had ordered L/54 according to seller response to question by customer but then realized that after washing the garment might shrink some and then become tight. Called Amazon and they placed a request to seller to change size to Xl/56. Seller came back that they had already shipped but indication in my orders showed preparing to ship. Well, Amazon took care of that and I was able to cancel and re-order in size Xl/56 I figured would be best. Order date:June 10th, Expected delivery: July 3rd - July 20th. Received June 20th! Well done Turkey's M.U.Akkad! Tried them on, fit great but a little more room than anticipated,  next day, washed garments in machine with cold water (since they are new) and dried on ultra low, tried them on again and fit is still good but a unshrunk, not complaining because I definitely like to wash worn undies with warm and dry on low so I know without a doubt that there will be shrinkage and the fit will be perfecto! With that in mind, you might want a little allowance, not too much because they have some stretch to them and if you wash on warm, you won't worry about shrinkage to where they don't fit! As far as quality control is concerned, there was one among five whose one leg was sown in a hurry, other than that, they are nice smooth cotton, comfortable, leg lace is no bother to me yet I get irritated with scratchy laces, this is no bother! I am satisfied with my purchase! Photos attached so you know what you are ordering! I hope this is helpful to you all! Anyway of availing more colors like black and beige/tan? Thanks! After developing shingles, I had to look for different underwear, as leg openings of regular underwear and their synthetic fibers were painfully irritating.  So while I had to wait for delivery from outside the U.S., it was worth the wait.  I wore them for the first time yesterday under pants.  They are comfortable, non-irritating and don't ride up.  In this cold November weather, they provide extra warmth, but I do imagine that they will be cool under a summer skirt or loose summer pants.  I washed them last night so I could wear them again today (as I only ordered one). I highly recommend this product and will order more! Much more well-made than major US brand & so much LESS EXPENSIVE (even including international shipping!)  Softer, thicker, more comfortable.  Pretty soft lace (comfortable as well) leg band.  Highly recommend.  This is a great style if you have to sit for long periods of time.  No annoying seams or hems to sit on! Ordered 1 to try out, i really like the product it's soft cotton, comfy to wear with cotton hygienic panel, fits true to size, I'm size 14 & ordered xl, fit great, I would only use these under dresses or skirts, not pants as it would probably add bulk, they're not skin tight, I tried to order more but out of stock, will keep checking.  Btw they launder well too, wish they came in more colors. These panties are simply amazing!  I don't know how many years I have been looking for something like this.  My main goal was to find something without elastic in the crease of my upper thigh.  I am allergic or sensitive to elastic in the crack of my body anywhere.  THEN, THE OTHER REASON:  I could never get pads or urine pads to stay in place, and this product accomplishes that.!  They fit snuggly and comfortably.  I can see that care, and common sense has went into the pattern of this item.  Crotch area doubled.  I just cant say enough about this panty..  I bought 8 and will be buying more.  Eliminates friction on thigh area, looks feminine and you name it. Nicely made and comfortable. Be aware the lace leg bands are not cotton, they are synthetic and stretchy. Nice gusset in the crotch, super comfortable. Larger sizes nicely proportioned, order larger if you're a big woman. I ordered according to the size chart, and the same size as other ""pantaloon"" style panties that I bought, but these are a little snug.  Other than that, they appear to be of good quality, and the fabric has a nice feel to it. I love these. I live in SE Texas and I get hot-flashes... wearing skirts, dresses or anything not snug was out of the question for me. I bought a single pair of these (and several other similar types) and they are, by far, the BEST!! I love the extended panel in the middle and generous fit. Great quality, keep me cool day and night.",1,1

"it's a beautiful ring but you get what you pay for and the plating is already coming off. However, it's a gorgeous opal or fake opal and my friend I got it for loves it. Everything is great and it came in the mail in perfect condition. The only thing I don't like is that after you've worn the ring for a while the black paint on the ring facing your finger starts to fade into silver If I could rate this with no stars I would. It took forever to get here, and it's not true to size at all. I ordered a 9 and I got sent a 9.5 which, was still too small for my fingers. It's a very tiny ring as well. I'm really disappointed. Takes up one whole segment of my finger and I am a man. No woman could ever wear this unless they were a Sasquatch... a little light not a heavy material.  but my sister loved it Ring was absolutely amazing. For the price you would think its bad but its really amazing! But rings I ever had. I would 100% by again Better than spected So pretty.  I've had the ring for several months and have worn it many times.  It is very pretty and has held up better than one of my other rings that was a lot more expensive.  Highly recommend.",1,1
"Update Jan 10, 2017 These are great belts.  They don't give like a lot of belts.  The quality was better than expected.  These are really well made.  On the downside, it will take you a little bit to get used to latching mechanism. There is a little trick to it. Push the belt just a hair tighter to ease the pressure on the latch and the belt opens easily.  However, the first time I tried I couldn't do it.  I absolutely love these belts and I have bought several.  I have several different brands and I like this brand the best. I purchased a leather SlideBelt and was impressed. Much better than the usual belt, quick to use, offered more features, a winner.  So I looked for a lighter weight belt for summer pants, ending up with a Marino Rachet Click belt.  Not so good.  Every time I sat down the belt loosened itself. I have returned the belt to Amazon and have ordered a SlidBelt.  Doing a little research, the Marino belt look like a previous model of the SlidBelt with a small tab to loosen the belt. SlidBelt is the answer, do not select a lower quality belt.  Amazon was very impressive in the return process. Immediate confirmation of my return and a commitment to a refund of every penny I paid. This is my first ratchet type belt. I'm surprised it took me this long to get here. I have always had trouble with belts not fitting right and with wear around the holes. The ratchet mechanism works perfectly, maintaining the perfect fit all day and is easy to open. The leather is of good quality and matches my dark brown shoes. The buckle is not too bright and is low profile (width, height and thickness), which is good for my slim waist. Super easy setup by cutting with scissors along sized lines provided on the back for a custom fit, followed by insertion of leather into buckle with a press fit closure that is strong and doesn't require any tools to close. Tip: to open, squeeze top and bottom together between two fingers where tab is, then move belt in a direction to tighten it. That's right, in the direction of tightening even though it sounds counterintuitive. Once you do that, you'll be able to squeeze the mechanism fully, unlocking the belt and allowing it to slide through easily in the direction of loosening. After a few days of wearing, I looked for the black one and it was not in stock! I bought the other Marino ratchet with Linxx style buckle, which appears newer, so I'll see how it compares. I'm worried that the newer model's buckle might be bulkier. Will update it write a review on that one to compare This belt is absolutely amazing! I wear it nearly every day! I do admit it takes a little getting used to as the way that you loosen it is by pressing the little button underneath the buckle (you also generally have to pull it tight a little to get the button depressed) but in the long run I believe it will make for a longer lasting belt as you are not constantly pulling the belt the other way to tighten and loosen it. There is definitely much more flexibility with this belt as well with the waist size which I also like. I never knew of these type of belts.  I am so glad I found it.  Easy to use.  I was going to buy a much more expensive one, but went ahead and purchased a less expensive one (to see how these types of belts actually work in real life).  The Marino I got is beautiful, functional and I cannot wait to get another (I have to wait until my regular ones wear out first). Great concept and good looking belt, but the Belt itself is not  wide as I'd like and the ratchet system often comes loose. Very frustrsting! Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but anytime there is some pressure oh the Belt the buckle let's loose. Bought two and was going to gift one. Changed my mind and am going to return them.",1,1
"With the holiday season, packages are constantly getting stolen off porches in the neighborhood. I decided to add some additional security to our house with this little camera. The camera is really small and inconspicuous. I was really surprised at how clear the picture was, too, letting me see everything on our porch very clearly. It's not meant to go outside so I have it at the front window pointing toward the door. I can clearly see anyone coming to the door for any reason. I have several cameras around my house for security but was looking for something discrete to record my son’s sitter. I normally prefer WiFi cameras so I can watch in real time, but they need to be plugged in constantly so in this case it didn’t suit my needs. The internal battery in this camera makes it simple for me to charge it and then move it to any location for up to 6 hours of continuous recording so its exactly what I was looking for, and the ability to set it to record all the time or just when it detects motion is great! The size is perfect; its a small cube which easily fits on my tv stand and since it’s black it’s camouflaged.  In the box is a card with information to get a free sd card which is perfect since that’s how footage is recorded. Conveniently, it also comes with a usb dongle to insert the sd card into my computer so my recordings can be viewed. Now I am more comfortable trusting others to care for my son. The less significant issue that the front of the camera is a light brown rather than matte black, and the face is a shiny material.  Makes concealing the camera more difficult.  The more significant issue is that concealing the camera within an enclosure or within a low light area results in a flashing light completely washing out the picture with every flash.  So your recording is a one second white wash out followed by one second image (between flashes), over and over.  I thought perhaps the flashing would stop after a while, but it does not.  I even attempted to place opaque tape over the LED lights on the back of the camera thinking perhaps that would stop the wash out effect, but that did not work, leading me to believe that the light is intruding into the image sensor internally from the LEDs.  The image is great if the camera is left out in the open in a well-lit area, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a surveillance camera.  Hopefully Conbrov will take note of this issue and fix it.  I just tested it.The tiny cam(two finger size) comes with a charging usb cable and a small magnetic mount that made easier and saved time when use that on in a car.No screw looks neat.I love that way.And the resolution is good.BTW the view angle is so wide that you can use it as a spy cam as well.I love it! It was very simple to set up. It came with a charger, micro USB, and a small stand. It charged really fast and was ready to go immediately. It doesn't come with a micro SD card, so you will have to get one, but you get one and put a micro SD card in, all you have to do is make sure the power is off, put the micro SD card in and turn it on. When you're ready to see what it recorded, all you have to do is power it down and pop out the SD card, and put it on any device that can read it. Then you can see everything. The small camera is good use. I use in my restaurant and it records everything. I really like the small cube design. Looks very modern and won't look like a camera at all. It's so compact it's very discrete and easily hidden and the motion sensoring capability making it so helpful, This is really a great little camera (see pictures for size comparison). It's very well built (metal with some hard plastic accents) and it feels solid in the hand. It includes a card reader and a magnetic mount bracket. I wouldn't use the mount, though, as I prefer for it to be inconspicuous. It works with micro-sd cards (I used a 16GB with no problems). Bought this to use as a nanny cam. Good to keep any eye on things when we are away also. Small size makes it easy to hide. I also like the night vision feature and also the motion dec feature is a reason i purchased.",1,1
"Fast delivery Product received fast. But I didn't like the product, colour did not look the same as what I expected and saw from the pictures and swatches. And the lipstick is very sticky, quality does not seem very good.",-1,-1
"UPDATE- Just got another pack. They are sooooo comfy. They do not shrink in the wash, and probably even get a little stretched out, so they fit better and better. I love these panties! They are very soft and stretchy, and are like boy shorts on my girl. My LO's underwear has been very tight & itchy on her, and I was looking for something that is tagless and soft. This isnt tagless but its very very soft and the cut is awesome on her. The colors are pastel too so its very girly, which my kid loves. She is on a growth spurt so I bought the 6-8 yrs old size so that there would be room for her to grow, for reference my LO is 46 lbs and 42 inches. I bought these panties in the 3-5 yr size, and they fit perfectly  (daughter wears size 5-6 pants). They are super soft and stretchy. Highly recommend! Panties are a little on the thin side, so I wouldn't expect them to last very long, but they're cute and they fit (and my daughter really likes them) so there you go. Fit was great for an average sized 7 1/2 year old.  Eagerly told upon seeing them that the look met with approval, but more importantly was later told that they are apparently very comfortable. My daughter was always having to adjust her underwear, until I got her these. We will probably never go back to regular underwear. She says they are super comfortable and she is no longer constantly picking at a wedgie. It says ""100% cotton,"" but I know it is not. Runs smaller than I expect. These are great. They are soft, fit nicely, not too tight, not too loose.",1,1
I love IT,1,0
"Very pretty. Runs small. I wear an 8-8.5 on my ring fingers. I ordered a 10 so this would fit my middle finger or index. Way too small. Fits my ring finger. This ring is very nice it looks real for sure I love it and would recommend it to everyone you do need long fingers to wear it. Really sparkles and shines I'm sure u will receive many complements. Emma This ring was a bit larger meaning from  top to bottom than I expected.  It also ran a bit snug even though I had ordered up a size.  I think this is because it takes up near the finger base to knuckle.  It is attractive and looks more costly than it was.  Next time I think I would opt to get stacking rings that are not quite so large in scale and overwhelming to the finger. I love the ring, I just got it today and it's beautiful Wife loved it until stones / fake stones of which we knew were due to price started falling out 3 now since 02/14 , 5 days . weird no other reviews say this It is very pretty but after 2 months it started turning my skin green. Don't wear it anymore. I would choose the rhodium plated one if I could go back in time. It is a beautiful ring!  But it is missing a stone, check your purchase carefully.  I will return it and definitely purchase another ring. Gorgeous ring. But bulky. It's very thick. And after 3 days, the bottom and sides rubbed off, turning my finger green and turning the ring back to copper. Not worth the price. It also gets caught on EVERYTHING. Ripped a shirt and bra on it. As well as snagged my sheets when I fell asleep with it on.",1,1
"Really like these ankle boots. I got the black pair. They look so cute on my feet. I normally wear size 7.5-8 depending on the brand, I ordered 8.5, figure if they are too big I can always put in insoles, but they fit well. So you might want to size up. Nice and great looking boots but they do run small, you might have to order half or one size up!! But it’s very comfortable !!! It’s everyday boots !! I love it I am size 6 and I ordered size 6. It fits perfectly. It’s comfortable and stylish! A must have boots for autum and winter! I ordered these for my daughter and she loves them.  They fit snug for the size we ordered, I would suggest ordering one size larger then you normally wear.  They are a good looking ankle boot. This is my first ankle boots, it fits my jeans well and I can wear it much time in the California winter. Like the shoes, and it fit perfectly to my wife's feet.  The texture on the PU leather looks better than the photos from the seller. It looks a very good shoes, and hope it could be genuine leather and last longer time. I liked it so much. Normally I wear 7.5/8 and,  I ordered 7.5, but it was a little bit small. Then I ordered 8.5. Now it is fine. I like it top opening circumference. Because I was looking for this kind of shoes. My order came yesterday. I did not try outside yet, but it looks like comfortable. Its a soft flexible ankle boot and fits exactly size 8. Black fits all casual and business casual outfits. It smells a little bit but gets better after getting off the package.",1,1
"I ordered a size 4T for my 3 yr old so he could wear the shirt mire than just in his bday. The fit is perfect! My son is not a big boy but he is bigger than most 3 yr old he even has room to grow in it :) Super cute shirt that looked great on my 3-year-old! So cute! They also send bday stickers with the shirt :) nice product! Fast shipping .... and fits perfect Very cute, fits my 3 yo perfectly. Fits good. Perfect!",1,1
"I use these in the classroom for students cell phones. I allow students to listen to music, but not use their phone. This allows them to keep their phones on the desk, without seeing the screen. All phones that I've tried fit in these, even with their cases on. They are super soft, so the kids don't have to worry about scratches. I bought the blue and yellow as those are the school colors and it's been working well! Good size for pocket cameras.  You know those cameras that the lens zooms out of the body when you turn them on?  They are handy to just stick in your pocket until you need them. But, mine always seem to turn on and open in my pocket. A nuisance but worse than that, they seem to collect pocket lint in that part that zooms out and after a while that lint works its way into the lens system and starts to show up as dots on the photos.  No matter how carefully you clean the lens, you can't get rid of the spots - because they are inside the lens where you can't reach them.  These microfiber pouches are lint free - put your camera in one of these and then put it in your pocket.  It adds no bulk at all and keeps pocket lint out of your camera. I turn mine inside-out so the seams (a possible source of lint) are on the outside.  A bit ugly that way but it works. I tend to like these types of lens carrying options because they take up less space and I already travel  with the well padded bag. These fit the bill and were extremely cost-effective! Used on smaller lenses they can be rolled up to provide every bit as much padding as the neoprene alternative options. I have been trying to find a pouch that is big enough for my Ipod Touch and my earbuds.  I bought a pouch about a month ago at a store that I thought would work.  The Ipod Touch fit but it was too small to put the earbuds in and it has already started to fray so I was looking for something larger and of better quality.  I saw a glass-case that was the right size but it was about $15 so I went on Amazon and found six of these for $7.95.  I ordered them on Thursday and they arrived on Saturday morning.  (Love Prime!)  The pouches are the perfect size - my Ipod Touch fits and there is plenty of room for the earbuds.  They appear to be of high quality but they are only two days old so I cannot comment on how long they pouches will last before fraying.  However, at this point, they are great and I would recommend them. These work as advertised. I use them for my regular glasses and sunglasses; Oakley, Serigeti. The clothe is soft and can be used to wipe your glasses/lens clean. The price is right and they arrived in a reasonable timeframe. I don't like the company initials on the product as it can make one think they are your initials. :) Just received and have already found many uses for these bags. First off they seem to be of very high quality and have a ton of uses. I am using some for small cords and devices that we will take on our travels this summer plus they are perfect for glasses and phones and do work as a cleaning cloth for both. The pouches are as advertised, but not quite what I was looking for.  They are the right size; however, the material is thin and the pouches are unlined, which I something I really wanted.  They are OK and I am using them, but not for the intended purpose.  I will keep looking for a product that better meets my needs. We typically keep our sunglasses in our cars, either throwing them on the dash or putting them in the cup holders.  As expected, they tend to get scratched up over time, from sliding around the dash or cup holder.  We also keep glasses in the saddle bags of our motorcycles, clears for night/rain and then the sunglasses when we're wearing the clears.  My clears had scratches all over, which made riding at night difficult, and then adding rain, made them worse.  These simple covers will now protect the lenses from getting scratched as they move around in the saddlebags, and will keep them protected better than reusing the plastic wrap they came in.",1,1

Works surprisingly well ... SO FAR.  Did not think it would be sturdy enough at first.  I still have a some reservation because I think this will work well provided your bottle has enough weight to firmly keep it in place.  With continued use the bottle will become lighter therefore will SHIFTING START TO OCCUR ???  I will update this review after I finish my liquid detergent bottle. Finally a gizmo that is super useful. Thank you! No more spilled soap. Neat little thing. Now I don’t have to make a mess sitting the cap down. Perfect for the laundry room no more drips on the counter! I love these keeps your laundry cups handy and drips off my dryer. Love this! Works with any detergent. No more drips! These are awesome and prevent dripping. Cheap and does its job!,1,1
"Absolutely love them.. bought one for,me and one for my fiance. Came when expected. Fits beautifully and is absolutely the best ever. I got a size 7 which is my ring size, I experienced a little discomfort because of the ring cut. If purchase may want to go up a 1/2 size for comfort. Not able to wear. I purchase the set his/her. It's definitely a great ring! But the only problem is that symbol of the crowns fade off in a week! Which is very odd.. Cause the ring is meant to be King an Queen. But it fades off soon.. But overall it's a good ring. They bands are the same width. The mens ring is not wider like in the photo. The crowns look like a sticker has been pressed on the ring. No detail to either crown, And his queen looks like it says hix queen also looks like a sticker not engraved. Me & my BFF got this as a promise ring I love the drawing of the crown BUT as time goes by it starts to fade and the writing isn’t visible anymore but we still like it Didn't come in half sizes, witch my girlfriend and I both needed. Nice rings though and easy to return. Beautiful ring. Was exactly what I was expecting. Very nice rings but the writing and the crowns have wore off within a week",1,1
"I bought it for a friend who loves to doode/draw whenever she has something to draw with and she loved it. This was a birthday gift for my artistic granddaughter who, after using it for a month, assures me it is a great set.  She really likes the charcoals and uses the pencils a lot. Everything that I need for my artworks. All pencils hardness, charcoal pencils and sticks, pencils sharpener for graphite and charcoal pencils, sandpaper pencil pointer, stumps they are versatile and there are 3 sizes that are perfect for different aspects of my artwork. I am very happy with this set. Thank you will definitely buy again. EDIT: I still like the kit itself, but the ""ebook library"" description is misleading. You can't actually download the books to your computer or Kindle. You can only view them while connected to the internet and logged in to their website. It's hard to zoom in each time you flip the page, and you can only view one page at a time. I've never seen anything like it, and wish the description mentioned this so I wouldn't have been so disappointed. This is a great drawing set. It has everything I need in one sturdy case. The best part is the digital library which has a number of books that are very helpful to a new artist. I'm sure many would be helpful to artists of any skill level. I definitely recommend this set. my granddaughter loves these. they were a gift for her birthday. she's 15 and very picky. I would recommend these for anyone who likes to sketch You can’t beat it for the price. Great quality and quantity. My daughter loves it and she is very artistic she is 10 ....",1,1

"These glasses are gorgeous! They have great quality and seem to last a while! Way better than I was expecting! However, they did not fit me at all! Very small, they fit my 10 year old niece perfect though! I hope I can find some similar to these but bigger. If you have a small, slim face these are perfect for you. i ordered these glasses and after a week they broke! I wrote a review about how they broke and the seller reached out to me asking if I would like a refund or a free new pair! I received a new pair at no cost to me and they are perfect and holding up great!! I really appreciate an awesome customer service like this seller has and these glasses are seriously so cute, everyone asks me where I got them!! I think the first pair was just a random fluke! These are just as I would hope they would look Bought this as a alternative because insurance refuse to give me frame, has my own prescribed lense mounted on this ones and they look great! I get so many compliments while wearing them. Have amazing grip in my tiny nose, look incredible chic, and visibility wise (being that I have prescribe lenses on it) it's great, I can look down and up as well as to the side without having to move my head getting complete coverage!  Love this one and will get in every single color. Relativately large, but for my face it's great. I got the large size though. Really cute, really well made, and fit an adult head! They are really cute and look high quality. Sadly I'm returning mine, because the frames themselves are very large and I think they look silly. My boyfriend said they have ""Golden Girls vibes."" Just know that they definitely make a statement and have an 80's look with the huge frames. Not my thing. I think they're so chic especially the red ones I got but they do feel a bit cheaply so be careful with them. I was disappointed by the low quality of materials used for the glasses (even considering the price) as well as the smaller and more narrow size of the frames compared to the photos. That being said the seller has contacted me and handled the situation really well, so I feel these are still worth trying because the seller has great customer service, so you can't go wrong.",1,1

"I'm a minimalist traveler--I can traveler anywhere for any length of time with just my carry on and backpack ... and I still probably take way too many electronics with me. But because I travel a lot, my biggest concern is accidentally leaving something behind -- and over the years, it did happen once where I left my kindle charger plugged into the wall of my hotel room. I thought the best way to resolve this concern was to purchase a bag that would have a spot specifically for each device and cord. That way a quick-once over will tell me exactly what is missing, if anything. I've tried various bags of the last year, including the amazon basics one, and I've always had to use at least 2 bags to fit everything I wanted to take. Man does this thing hold a lot. I can store 2 phone charging cords, 2 iPod cords, 1 red cord for my flashlight, both my Anker portable chargers, 3 pens, 3 USB blocks and so much more. I love it. It's great for travel and stuff. I have been wanting a bag like this just worried it wouldn't be big enough, I didn't want to pay more than I did for this one so I gave it a try. I really love that it is more of a case instead of just flat. It was a little bit flimsy until I put in the divider pieces and that made it stand up and really look more impressive and firmer. It holds a LOT, after putting in what I needed I had room left over. I'm thinking it is that middle piece that gives it so much room and I love the deep section on the bottom which allows for thicker cords or just bigger things you want to keep in one place. I had everything just thrown in a drawer and couldn't take it anymore. Now when I need something I know exactly where it is and it's so much easier to get to, no untangling cords from each other. I love this case, it really is a great organizer. Any questions, I'll be glad to answer if I can. The prefect bag for many cables - I've purchased several different travel organizers and they always fell short - not enough depth - to small or to large - then I got this bag - holds all the cables I needed when traveling with the family (3 of each 1ft, 3ft, 6ft and 10ft) lightning and micros cables (that's 24 cables) and 4 2in1 lightning/micro cables, 2 power bank bricks 10,000mAh and 3 power bank sticks, 4 port USB car charger, 5 port USB wall charger, spare camera with batteries - plenty of room to spare (cannot ask for better traveling companion - liked it so much I bought a couple more for each member of the family who also travel abroad.- stay away from those thin travel case - the photos they use show a lot of cable but then try closing the bag - they only deal with a few short cables at best and no power bank bricks or wall chargers - I should know - I bought four and threw them out (lesson learned). I purchased what from what I thought was copper, it's more a gaudy copper gold. Next time I'll purchase the Navy Blue. LOADED with pockets and loop pouches inside. I've a Braun shaver (large) in one pocket, a Microforce shaver in a loop. I've small bags of Squeeze Pods (lotions, shaving cream, shampoo, etc) in the loop pouches. There's three velcro tabbed dividers inside to organize your items (or gadgets like mine). I've created a modular men's toiletry/first aid kit with electronic items (pens, gadgets, etc). Very useful, rugged design and construction. Perfect kit for the gadgeteer (like me). RECOMMEND: Buy a couple. This gear organizer is so handy!  It has two separately-zipped sections, the top for very small items like wires, and the bottom for larger ones, like chargers, power supplies, and bulkier wires.  I used to stash all these different pieces here and there in different pockets in my suitcase sized equipment case and briefcase, but now all these little pieces fit in one small case where I can find them easily.  It's laid out so that each item is held in its own space but when you open it you can see everything.  The organizer is soft-sided and weighs practically nothing. I've used this product twice now and it's great! It's very well organized, well designed and thought out.  It's perfect for your cables and chargers and other small electronics. I'm very happy with this and could recommend it to anyone. This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He was a little concerned at first because it looked small but after opening it and inserting all of his various electronics cords, batteries, ear buds, etc. he was very pleased.  There was even extra room!  Keeps everything visible and neatly organized.",1,1
"I started out keeping all my extra cords, etc. in a cigar box until I knew I was outgrowing it. I began to look for a case that would hold all my different cords, memory cards, ear buds, chargers, remotes and such and found how different they were. I had certain criteria in mind and finally found one that met what I needed. What would be significantly important to me was a case that could hold a variety of sizes of items. But those items needed to be seen, not hidden behind a closed panel. Jelly Comb solved that with its multi-pockets that are made with mesh closures. I can see what is in each pocket because the pockets are made of black mesh against a lime green material.There is one pocket that is one side of the bag, measuring 9 inches by 5 1/2 inches that has a lime green closure. In that I put my largest items, so I do not need to see what's in it. I wanted a bag that had protection of some sort, not a hard shell, but a soft padded shell so I could fit it into various positions. This does. Two sturdy zippers with holders provide the openings to two separate interior bags, which in effect, allow for more storage with less bulk ergonomically. It has a wrist strap attached with a carabiner and I would have preferred a handle but I can attach another carabiner to the other side and wrist strap to carry it that way. I am amazed at how much this carries, still closes easily and does not look like I had to sit on it to close it. I currently have 16 pieces that I carry in it without any problem. The case itself is a wipe clean with a sponge measuring 7 inches by 10 inches. Wristlet measure 7 inches. Perfect for traveling, great stocking stuffer and happy to no longer have to search for cords in a drawer. With 18 pockets that measure 3 inches by 1 1/2 inches, a 3 1/2 by 7 inch zippered pocket, 2- 4 by 5 inch pockets and one 5 1/2 by 9 inch pocket I have plenty of room to store future accessories. Just remember to label your cords if need be. I received this item very quickly in perfect condition.  I decided to get the orange over the green.  I don't have a lot of cables just yet added to it, but so far what I have added works well!  I can easily put all my cables in one place vs different pockets in my backpack.  The straps hold the cables nice and tight and has plenty of sections for cables. With the see through pockets, are great for other devices like my usb hub or larger cables.  Also the large pocket in the back is great for really large cables that would not fit in the slots well.  So that works out well.  The SD card slot may come in handy one of these days too!  It feels very durable and possible resistant to water with the type of material it is made out of.  Well worth the cost of this! I have a lot of cords and cables and they were everywhere and wife was not happy about it and I have needed something like this for a while. My family consists of 4 tech obsessed people. In the past, when we would travel, it would be a cord nightmare! Now that I've gotten this bag, all of our cords can be organized and easy to retrieve and/or identify. I was so excited when this arrived and I opened it! There are so many ways to organize our stuff. I just can't wait until our next trip!!! I was having a little issue with my cables... they were in 3 small bags in my carry on luggage... I do travel a lot ... and I was looking for a bag that I could use to fix this little problem... so I bought this one ... and I’m completely satisfied about it... good material quality, amazing finishing! And now I have just one bag for all my cables!!!! It’s just perfect 👌!! This was a smart purchase. I love to keep things organized. I hate wasting time looking for stuff.  I was using several makeup bags when traveling to transport all the cords, earbuds and chargers. But often ended up a tangled mess. But now that I’ve packed I’m so glad I have everything in one convenient spot. This thing is great, it even has a handy pouch for sd cards. Recommended. This organizer bag not only carries all the cords and chargers but it also organizes earbuds,  car charger ,  misc  items and so much more. I travel quite a bit and I was always looking for the chargers at the airport but not only are they organized now they are not tangled with each other .....the bag is padded with mesh pockets and zippered compartments. love my bag This bag is incredible, seriously. The quality of it is great and it does its job really well. I use it as an organizer bag for my backpack so my bag is not full of random cables, flash drives, etc. I use it as a central place to keep all my charger cables, data cables, flash drives that I carry so I know where they are at at all times.",1,1
"Visited my son for parents weekend at school and had sent a snack box prior. I was VERY dissapointed with the size of the box! It was this little box crammed with snacks and like everyone else said, small sizes! They are like mini bags!! Not quite sure I would send this again! Disappointed.  The photograph and description (45 count ultimate sampler...) gave  the perception of items being larger than they appear in the picture or that the items were  full-size.  When the small box arrived and opened, it was very apparent an ""item"" consisted of a small hot ball, a bite-size Twizzler, mini-size bags of peanuts and mini-size bars, not full-size by no means.  I had hoped this would have been enough for a meeting of 30 people but 5 easily demolished the box in a matter of minutes.  The price is too high for what you get in the box. The bomb! Normally, the snack packages sold on Amazon are pretty good, some missing items replaced with others here and there but no real problem. However, this is the first time where they just completely miss the mark. I received 6 specific items in a box of 45: a rice crispy square (cocoa), organic fruit snacks, white cheddar cheez-it, shortbread cookies, m&m cookies, and smarties (lots of smarties). So, not only are we well off the mark with the list provided above, but I received 1 of each item except for the smarties where I received 39. Smarties are good, but I'm alright with only a few packages, thanks. As you cannot return this item for its purchase price, or anything similar I will not be buying Blue Ribbon again. Bought as a “support” snack assortment for my college freshman... I actually ordered “support your student” snacks from another retailer for a grouped set... I way overpaid for those 4 tiny packages (welcome to campus, midterm encouragement, just because & finals support)... my college student actually like this assortment better. A nice idea.  A collection of snacks.  Good size, lightish amounts, of tasty foods.  Might have liked more of one and less of another type, but overall enjoyed.  Took several on a plane trip to snack on board and in the airport.  Worked just as hoped, and at home I'm not going to finish a whole big bag if snacks now.  Like the small sizes. Great assortment, this order lasted me a month, all items were fresh and uncrushed. Not the healthiest options, but definitely tasty. The individual packaging is great for portion control and taking on-the-go. I sent this snack care package to my B-I-L who is deployed at this time.  He loves getting this snack packs as they do not have any stores in the area where he is located.  He was extremely happy and told me the box was full of goodies.  This care pack is perfect for deployed soldiers, college students and just as a yummy gift!  I totally recommend this package and will most likely be ordering again.",1,1

"Rings are really cute, but for knuckle rings they run large.  Ordered them for my 115 lb daughter, and they were too large even for me at 170 lbs. They are thin and easy to wear. Perfect for a young girl. You do not feel bad if you loose one. Love all the rings and fit almost perfectly Superfast delivery and product as described! Very cheap quality and didn't fit well at all. Theses rings are CHEAP!!  Within minutes of putting on one of the rings it broke! I loved the different styles of rings. They all fit well on my ring fingers. I'm a size 6 on those 2 fingers. I wish a few were bigger so I could wear more than 2 They green your fingers after wearing them for a week. They're super cute, just turns your fingers green which blows",1,1
"I been looking for a pot and pan set for a while and seen the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it. It is amazing quality and I absolutely love it!!!! This is one of the best items I purchased, the weight, the handles are great, easy to clean.  I also love the design. After the first use, which involved with only boiling water in the large cooking pot, rust marks appeared on the bottom of the pot (see picture). This is something I really don't think should happen on a 150$ set of cookware. The marks would stay after a manual cleaning with water and soap of the pot. Excellent set of pots & pans! Was a little skeptical after reading a few negative reviews, but we are very pleased after using them now for 3 months! NOTHING sticks to them and the distribute the heat evenly!! Really nice pot set that works on induction surface! I have been using Allrecipes' 8” nonstick skillet for over a week.  Have made scrambled eggs, grilled cheese, home fries, caramelized onions, sausage, a frittata, omelet, potato & zucchini pancakes, french toast sticks, hamburger steak with sauteed mushrooms, and more...I’ve used it a lot!  I’ve had a set of Zwillling J.A. Henckels ceramic-lined  skillets for about six years, and thought that nothing would ever measure up.  Well, this little skillet has made an impact, and a good one!  Not only does it look and feel like a quality piece of cookware, I love the way it cooks evenly.  When you cook a frittata, for example, that’s apparent.  When I bought my Henckels skillets, I became accustomed to cooking at lower temperatures, so no adjustment was necessary when using this cookware.  I also do not even own a metal spatula, so I’ve used my plastic/nylon or wooden utensils when cooking in this skillet, and I’d recommend that you do the same.  I do have a small scratch which I’m assuming came from pulling something out of the skillet with a metal fork, so I won’t do that again.  I always hand wash my cookware, and this skillet’s cleanup is a breeze. Disclosure:  Allrecipes sent me this product to try and review. First let's get this out of the way: Disclosure: Allrecipes sent me this product to try and review. I really like the heft of these pans, and how evenly they cook. The non-stick seems very durable, and everything slides right off.  The triple thickness bottom lends to extremely even cooking, and I really like the shape of the pan with the deep sides.  The handle gets a bit warm but if you hold it at the end it's not an issue.  I love the look as well - classic, quality stainless.",1,1
"I was confused because some of the reviews said this tea was bitter and horrible. I thought it was delicious...and then I figured out why someone else would think it was horrible. You have to lightly or quickly use the sachet and pull it out. If you steep the tea any longer, and it grows dark in color, it does taste bitter. But if you steep it lightly..it really is one of the best teas you'll ever taste. I LOVE VANILLA and if you are reading this you know how hard it is to find a true vanilla flavor in tea.  Harney & Sons Vanilla Comoro Is beautifully packaged and uses a teepee like bag rather than the straight square ones.  The vanilla flavor is strong but not quite as strong as the Mighty Leaf Vanilla Bean which I think I like better.  Both teas come in a fabric pouch rather than paper and the tea leaves are just beautiful as well as yummy!  I think it's a matter of personal taste/preference. My very favorite Harney & Sons tea!  This decaf Vanilla Comoro Black Tea is Full of Flavor!  I drink a lot of tea throughout the day and into the late evening. This tea has a wonderful flavor, it tastes like a regular tea, yet after several late night mugs, I can close my book and easily go to sleep.  I absolutely love this tea! I like and frequently purchase fine teas. I'm a tea snob. While this is not a fine tea, its a very very good tea when considering the reasonable price, especially when considering the tin. The flavors are nice, mellow, and it re-brews multiple times well. I don't care for the fact that there is artificial flavoring in it. This is a great tea - very rich, full bodied vanilla flavor and scent - definitely one of my new favorites! If you like to sweeten your tea with honey - uhh - take a taste of the tea first ~ it is somewhat naturally sweet flavored (okay, I know this because I put my normal amount of honey in and took a sip then ran immediately to the mirror to see if my teeth were rotting out ;o) ). Maybe it's because this is decaf, but this didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for. One thing I will say about Harney & Sons teas is that you can over steep them and they NEVER get bitter - I think it's a testament to the high quality of their teas. I love their Paris tea, however, this one doesn't have the flavor intensity I was expecting. Lovely smooth mouth feel, but not enough vanilla flavor for me. Bigelow has a vanilla black tea that has more vanilla flavor than this one at half the price. I love this tea. I've been building my collection of Harney&Sons tea and needed a sweet tea for mornings. The tea bag is strong enough for a re-steep which I always do. It pairs real well with some delicious Nutella on bread for those sugar crazed like myself. I'm already ordering the 50 bag refill to put in my empty tin can. This tea is so delicious! It has a very strong vanilla flavour, but it isn't a sickening, ""fake"" taste. It also tastes very similar to almonds, though there are no almonds or almond flavours in it. I do prefer it hot with cream and stevia, but it is pretty good black. Though it's a little on the expensive side, I do think it is worth the price as a little indulgence. I plan to buy this tea many more times in the future.",1,1
"LOVE it!! GREAT tool-less design, includes a foam pad to snug up the connection if you're installing say a 7mm instead of 9mm...the foam will keep it nice and tight and from wiggling around. Just so simple. I acquired a 250 Gig SSD from a computer when a friend updated her PC and no longer wanted the old system. So I picked up this little HD case and put the SSD in it. Little difficult getting the case to release and open but once I got it open , slid in the drive, locked it in and works perfectly. Formatted it for my Android devices, loaded 190 gig of music on it and now I have a Low Power usage high volume OTG device I can plug into any time and have all my music in my pocket for the cost of this little case. It took me a couple of minutes to learn how to open it as the case is plastic and I didn't want to force anything, but it's easy once you've done it. I installed my HDD (a Toshiba disk from a Macbook Pro), plugged it in and it ran. The box features an LED that flickers as the disk is working and goes into slow-blink when you've ejected the disk to remind you that it is still connected and drawing power - a nice feature for laptops. The external enclosure works perfectly as described.  The case seems pretty sturdy and is rather simple to open/swap drives as needed, and the case lock is a nice feature (it doesn't lock access to the drive, just locks the drive in place). Well, it works. Having upgraded many internal hard drives, I often have an original drive left over that works perfectly.  I've tried many different hard drive enclosures, but many of these have been a little flimsy or fragile, which has compromised their reliability.  However, the Zheino case is the best I've found.  It's sturdy and very well built.  It was also easy to use and worked perfectly first time.  I've since replaced all my other hard drive cases with the Zheino unit.  It's built to last, easy to use, and offers a great use for left-over internal hard drives. Worked perfectly. I purchased this to replace the housing on a ""Rugged"" drive that apparently wasn't that rugged. Installation was stupid easy. Just slide the drive in and close the cover. This is one of the best enclosures I've ever purchased!  The 2 I bought few months back were 3 dollars less. Still a great deal at $9 each that I'm picking up 2 more!  These are perfect for when you replace your console's hard drive, which is what we did this Black Friday. Turn that drive an external one!",1,1
My granddaughter wears a 13 so that's what I ordered. The shoe is too big but she had to wear them to her affair. Though she fell down twice she loves them. They really are quite beautiful. They were the talk of the event. The strap is covered in rhinestones which prevents one from tightening the strap to fit more snug to the foot. Is a little loose for my daughter. But very pretty ad fit fine with an extra pair of socks on👍🏻 These shoes are very cute in person. 5 STAR RATING I bought these for my 7yr old granddaughter. She absolutely LOVES them. They are very nice shoes with a ton of sparkle. Just lovely. I Ordered these Shoes for A Friend whose Granddaughters are going to A Father/Daughter Dance at School and we all Love them perfect size and price Beautiful shoe. My daughter and I love the look but sadly have to return. Size was too small,1,1

"I usually have to buy a size up to fit my shoulders and then suffer with wearing a tent for my waist.  Oddly enough, these athletic shirts are actually made for men with athletic builds.  Size L fits my shoulders and waist fairly well -- for contrast,  If you're active, be it running, lifting,cycling or whatever sport you love, then getting one of these is, in my opinion, essential. As you sweat it wicks the moisture from your body and actually helps cool you down faster so you can go harder! I wear mine to work and at play and even when I'm just out and about as it looks nice to boot. It never stretches or shrinks in the wash so you don't have to worry with whether or not it's still going to fit you in a month. I'm probably going to order several more. This is a really nice shirt.  The only reason for not providing 5 stars is that it is NOT tagless & it runs a bit larger than other shirts I've bought to workout in -- I'm 70"" tall with a 42"" chest & weigh 185, & take a large in most workout clothes (shirts & pants).  I ordered a large in this shirt & it fits very loosely, but not tent-like.  Further, the length is actually better than most of the shirts that I've purchased, so I might take a chance & order one of these in a medium. Love the design. Used it several times for workouts. Awesome. I have another source for my moisture wicking shirts. I was planning on wearing this shirt to the gym, hadn't decided on if it would be an undershirt or the only shirt I needed.  When I put it on, the neck was very loose and it didn't appear or feel like the shirt was designed correctly.  The neck was way too big.  I will only wear this shirt around the house, it is light, but it is not at all what I was hoping for.  Especially for the price. Good product-- fit a little on the smaller side Very comfortable shirt to wear even if the sun is bright and it is hot. The wetter you get the cooler you stay... I thought it would come in to tight ,but surprise it fits just right.I'm 5-8 !87lb  just right",1,1
"Delivery was fast and i received item in good condition. The box is original and it is an authentic product. Will definitely recommend frens and family ! Happy with this purchase! Working well.   For newbies to fitbit like me:  Do take note n remember to charge up fully (2hrs) before trying to install as I had to try a few times n thought I had a faulty product. I realized that I need to get it fully charged before installing when I googled. Also had some difficulty installing as my IPhone 6s Plus could not sync initially. found out that this can be resolved by resetting the fitbit. If it happens, unpair the fitbit on your iPhone first n restart the whole installation process. Click on the button at the side of the fitbit charger with the fitbit attached to reset n reinstall. It should work after resetting! I'm satisfied with the delivery services from Lazada. I received the products before the estimatef delivery date. The product was being well packed. I'm satisfied with the product :) It's a great workout buddy  Product delivered was fast. Product is exactly the same as the picture. Functiality ok except it is not water resistant to wear it to Swimming or bathing. Light and easy to wear. Feel that the face is slightly too thick to wear to bed. I have problems as I like to slide my hand under the pillow. Good buy! Deliver on time and Works perfectly!",1,1

"My slim 4 year old wears a large and my skinny, They fit perfectly around the waist, but looser in the legs than your normal boy Hanes boxer briefs. I read reviews prior to my purchase and knew this going into it. They are so cute and cozy for my son to wear lounging around the house! They are not overly large, just not skin tight. The boxers briefs are totally adorable but I only gave them 1 star as I have ordered them twice now in a size 4-5 and BOTH times I received a size 6-7!!! Very disappointed I absolutely love these underwear and so does my son, great fit, just a lil small but still no problem, and he loves the dinosaur print I will be ordering lots more, I'm very happy with the quality and fit,not baggy and odd shaped like the ones you buy in the store My son is wearing a 5T so I ordered these in the hopes that they would last awhile. They fit great and there's a little room to grow. They seem like very good quality and the material is very nice. I would definitely buy them again, especially for the price. Yes dinosaurs should be on everything! My toddler is a little disappointed with the drawings' vagueness of each ""species"", since he loves identifying them, but otherwise no complaints. Purchased these for my dinosaur loving daughter who can't seem to find any underwear that compare. She LOVES THEM. Says they don't ride up and fit her perfectly. These are my kids favorite underwear. The fit is great, fabric soft and  the waistband keeps them secure. Highly recommend these.",1,1
"These have been an amazing therapy tool with my autistic son. He loves looking through things like bowls and cups to get different colors and views. So these glasses are so much fun for us. We use them as a reinforcer when trying to work on not so fun things and then he gets to wear them for a few minutes. They fit him just right. Plus, they're pretty heavy so it works on his sensory issues of having anything on his face/head. I'm very impressed on how they've stood up to toddler abuse. These glasses are so much fun! My three year olds love them. I'd definitely recommend supervision with them, as they can't see clearly in them. Watching my son to try to walk around and grab objects (I see two of everything, mommy!) was hilarious. We all got a good laugh. We also enjoyed looking at lights with them, as they made some really neat colors and shapes. They seem of good quality as well, and they have been able to withstand toddlers, which is always a plus in my book. I love these glasses! I first tried them on at night inside and played around with some christmas lights and other colorful lights and the glasses made everything so pretty. I also tried them on outside in the day time, and they make everything look so fun.  It's very hard to see through them and see your surroundings, so make sure you're in a safe place or with someone else who can navigate and watch you. I plan to use these at concerts with all the lights and I think they will be awesome in a concert or laser show setting. Great purchase and product. These glasses are so fun!  I bought them for my sons and the whole family has enjoyed playing with them. They are a little difficult to walk around in due to the fracturing of what you see, so wouldn't recommend moving around a ton in them.  But they are very well constructed, the frames are nice and heavy which makes them very sturdy and you don't worry about them breaking.  They also come with the cleaning cloth and a little bag for storage.  Very fun glasses. We purchased these for my youngest Daughter. She was crying because she left her sunglasses out on the floor and unfortunately they got stepped on. So we surprised her with these since its not really sunglasses weather here, and she absolutely loves them. They are heavier than expected but they are fun. You really can see through them and they are rainbow like. She calls them her diamond glasses and says she feels like a star. My granddaughter is all into cosplay so these are perfect for her.  They are very sturdy, not cheap throw away glasses. The whole family had to try them on in different settings, they were a lot of fun.  They are great for taking silly picture.  She is going to a concert soon and plans on bring them along.  These will take the concert lighting to a whole nother level. I bought these cause I thought they looked really cool and I love go to concerts and taking my kids too! I chose the black ones because I love black and they look really awesome! My kids love them and think they are super fun! I would definitely recommend these to anyone who loves to go watch live music! Also they wear a really great price! These are amazing! I used to have Kaleidoscopes when I was a kid. I havent seen them in forever. I actually forgot about them. I seen these glasses and knew they were a must have for my kids! They bring back so many memories! They are nicely made and work just as the ones did when I was little.",1,1
"Awesome product and a fast arrival. I will be recommending this brand and company to all friends who are looking into gaming computers. Would not recommend unless you want to run Windows 7 on this system. The Motherboard on this desktop was made in 2007-8 and is not able to run the new Windows 10 systems at all. Multiple Blue Screen errors like ""memory management"" and ""bad pool header"" while online on a browser, and while in action clients (very bad for a ""Gaming Desktop""). Sent it back to the manufacturer for repairs and it came back only to continue. Refunded soon after. Would recommend you build your own so you know exactly what went into it.",-1,-1

"Beware, you are gambling with this phone. They clearly don't test these phones, they just wipe the memory, clean them, and hope they work. I happened to get one that doesn't. The phone looks brand new, not a scratch on it. However, the SIM reader is shot, and it won't activate. A Verizon technician cleaned the reader and tried multiple SIM cards, this phone is simply defective. It's going back. This phone works flawlessly, and looks and works as if it was brand new (and not refurbished). This was a much cheaper route of getting a replacement phone after accidentally breaking my original S5, all I had to do was take my sim card out of the original and plug it into the replacement. Phone came with ""ghosting"" of old screen remnants displayed on screen at all times. I can still return but how annoying to have to return your phone and switch over again? Don't buy I just wrote a review not too long ago saying how great the phone worked but I am writing another one stating that it's defective. The screen isn't working properly anymore. Sometimes it takes up to 15 minutes to turn the screen on after pressing the button multiple times. Forced to return it This phone said unlocked verizon + gsm. I wanted to use it as a gsm phone on att but could not since it was verizon only. Description was very unclear.  Bought to replace my phone now am without a phone for another 3 days while i wait for the correct phone (hopefully) to arrive. After several months of use, I can say I really love this phone! Came without all the stuff (stupid games, etc) that take up memory. Easy to operate, clear voice on both speaker for ear & other. Takes great pictures (for what it is) with a zoom function. And, it has reception in many places which are sketchy for it. Tbh.. I was scared to order this product after reading some of the awful reviews.. but I gave it a chance and worried if I made the right choice.. well I worried until today it came in the mail and its everything I hoped it would be. There's no outside damage, works perfectly and I know I'll be able to use my service (Tmobile) with this. Yes it is unlocked but you have to call your provider to get the codes to have your phone connect to your providers service. Yeah its going to say you have the wrong Sim card in but that doesn't mean it doesn't work but sadly you can only remove that by ending the process but it will return if your phone turns off for any reason but that's not a big deal. I wish I had ordered this a month ago instead of replacing my S5 screen just for it to go out again because of other damage due to it failing. If everything goes good with this phone I'll be buying my boyfriend one. I'm so happy I bought this phone and that I haven't had any problems. BUT if I do begin to have problems that aren't caused by me I will update my review but for now... 5 stars && thank u so much!! Received yesterday, going back today. Charging port is extremely worn and phone wont charge unless I hold the cord just right. I checked with multiple cords I use in other phones. Even the original wide cord that comes with these phones falls right out. Looking at the micro usb side, it appears corroded and the center tab looks chipped. I ordered another, hopefully this one works.",1,1
"worth the money Good reception and clear, loud audio, battery lasts a long time. Functions as FM radio, micro SD card player, computer speaker. Also includes a led torchlight. Light and portable for whole day of outdoor / travelling use. A USB outlet port to charge other devices e. g. mobile phone would be useful to have.",1,1
"I love sending out Happy Mail to other artists on YouTube, and part of the process is to package everything attractively.  These bags are awesome for this - they look good and the recipient can use the bags in mixed media.  I wish they had more colors! These were just what I was looking for! I was looking for small bags in a red or pink color to package jewelry orders. The size is perfect as is the color. At only 7 cents each, the price was perfect, too. Delivery was quick. These would also work great to hold party favors, cookies or a slice of cake. I was wishing to go-green so started checking for eco-friendly paper bags to use for party favor return gifts. I came across these and ordered after reading some reviews. As expected, they were strong enough to hold 2 bananas looked pretty cute and good. These are super pretty and work well for packaging and shipping items that I sell. They are pretty sturdy and don't seem like they will tear or crumple easily. Good quality bags and perfect for the jewelry I sell...will buy more 4 sure! Absolutely beautiful! I love them and they make a great impression when I use them for packaging. Great size too. Love these bags.  Will be reordering when I need more. Love these for handing out my essential oils samples",1,1
Received it pretty fast within the stated time range.Awesome quality and features as close to the original.been using it on a daily basis!! Zipper not of good quality Ok ok good,1,1

"My nose is not pierced, so when I saw the reviews that you can't use this as a fake piercing, I questioned if I should've cancelled my order.  I got the nose rings and I adjusted them with pliers, and they look great!  They do really poke into your nose, but you get used to it really quickly.  So yes, you can use it as a fake nose ring as well. I am very sensitive to metal and had a problem with the first ring that I bought when it made my nose swell and was so painful that I almost could not take it out, but I have had no problem with these rings. They were a little too big for my nose but just bending them in a little bit made them perfect. I also don't think I have ever gotten a piercing in more easily, and I have 7 others. I've had the gold one in for about a week and a half now and I love it, no problems whatsoever. I absolutely love these! They're incredibly comfortable and they bend easily to fit your nostril. Awesome!!! I’m a little confused as to it being fake as stated in some of the reviews. But I actually have a nose piercing and wanted to go from a stud to a hoop. It took a while to figure it how to put it in... so u have to slide it in from the inside out... and it’s not easy. It was a little to wide so I bent it a little. But it works and I have no complaints thus far. It’s been almost a month from my purchase and there’s no tarnish or fading and it fits secure and won’t fall out. Wish it was longer to create more of a full loop look when placed in. Used YouTube to help with install. Great product. When I opened the bag I was shocked to see how different the product looked from the pictures online. I apparently ordered the camo ones bc all I got was a bag full of air. Got the box but no rings in it I have looked EVERYWHERE for nose rings like this and I finally found them! The are the perfect size in diameter and I love the flat side instead of having to shove some tiny ball in between like other styles offer. It was a little difficult to get it in the first time as you have to put it in from the inside but after the first time, I have never had any problems and I can get them in and out without any difficulty!",1,1
"We’ve had these for about 9 months now and are really pleased. The coating is somewhat delicate and can be easily damaged or fail but for the most part they perform exactly as described. I wish they would give the option to purchase with hanging handles or not, seems a shame to spend a couple hundred more on more handles when I really only need one set. I saw them at SAMS club being demoed and thought they looked amazing. I just got them for Christmas and have used them several times. I'm in LOVE! I didn't have to soak egg pans for days. I can't believe all it takes to clean is a simple wipe with a paper towel for most jobs. Being a mom of four young kids I appreciate cleanup time being cut to almost nothing. They are light weight and seem like they'll last forever. I'm very happy! I love the new set of cookware. We bought at a special show doe at a local SAM's, and ended up buying the largest set they had, including griddle, Wok, Dutch Oven, and the cook top that is so much quicker and easier than heating up a stove top to boil water for quick batch of noodles or rice. Customer Service has also been outstanding as I did break a lid, probably my fault, but put it on a hot pot after the water had come to a boil and it broke. I love the larger skillets for cooking eggs, or making toasted cheese, etc. Have had a year now and really enjoy using our kitchen much more than when I owned another good (and expensive) name brand, but it didn't last. I take care of all of my cookware, and hand wash it all, no dishwasher. Should be the last set I will ever have to buy, and based on my experience so far, I think that is an accurate statement.  Watch for the demonstrations at your local fair, SAM's or where ever they might have demonstrations done, and just watch. It sells itself. The best deals are there as the yare trying to move product, and typically I have seen much higher prices, even on-line. Well I’ve been cooking on my set for a year and a couple months now... here it is. The heat distribution is not even, its perfect. No hot or cold spots and I have spent some good money on other pans. The non stick is the same as when I got it, and I do cook a large variety of menus from stir fry on the stove top to beef Wellington’s in the oven. Amazing results. I’m not a chef but I cook as a hobby. I love recreating high end menus at home, like Gordon Ramsey’s beef Wellington. These pans rock, Love the versatility. I’ve used many pans... and so far I do not see myself replacing these. Just having the ability to take my 3 qt stock pot and make a birthday cake for my wife is awesome enough and I don’t have to soak the dang thing! I bought a wok & a large frying pan over a year ago & loved them so much (still do) that the next time we saw them - at a home show - we bought this set! And I usually take the 11"" pan with me when I travel on business. It's light enough to tuck into a carryon and helps me eat healthier and save money. My wife and I cook all the time, and over the years have used just about every kind of cookware. We've gotten away from non-stick because so many of the brands we see either don't have reliable surfaces (and we hate the idea of eating those chemical flakes) or don't cook like real cookware should.",1,1
"It started up great, had no issues with it yet.  It is VERY quite compared to my  Alienware R4 Aurora(2012).  I played Overwatch on ultra settings and the map loaded right away. I can't wait to start streaming on this pc. Purchased this for my son. I'm not a gamer, so I can't rattle off specs or performance details. But I think it's a good gaming PC based on the fact that he hasn't left the game room or checked his instachat or snapagram in two days. When I asked him how fast it was, he first said ""I can play Rust on the highest level graphics with no lag!"" When I asked him to translate that into something a parent would understand, he said ""geez dad, I dunno, like faster than getting diarrhea after eating Taco Bell?"" I'm guessing it's fast. As I was browsing through gaming computers, I came across this beast of a machine. The boot time is very fast compared to previous rig, which would take 4 minutes to restart or booting up. Whenever I boot this baby up, it only takes about 30 seconds or less which is amazing. Every game that I played is on ultra, with over 60 FPS (Frames Per Second). You will not be disappointed by this fancy-ass machine, you will also not regret buying it. It is by far the best quality, performance, and price that I have every came across. As soon as I purchased this, I received it on the fourth day, which is pretty quick. I would personally recommend this computer to any pc-gamers out there. Good job, HP! Great gaming PC overall and you can upgrade it if you decide to get a bigger case for bigger graphics cards. I have played Overwatch, Battlefield One, Call of Duty WWII, Rocket League, Fortnite, and many more on either almost max graphics settings without any drop in frame rates. The only two main cons that I would say that this product has is that even though it is says you can have two monitors running at the same time, you have to open the BIOS settings and actually turn on the setting in order to fully utilize the second monitor... -.- Which is a small problem but still kind of a dumb setting to have from the factory. The second con would be that even though the case for this is very minimal and efficient in size but the components inside are a little cramped together which sort of forces you to upgrade the case for future parts. Well, hold on.  Things change.  A few hours ago I got a Warranty Popup from HP.  They say my warranty expires in December, 2018.  What happened to my year warranty.  HP says the warranty was activated in November 2017.  Funny, I purchased this computer in February, 2018, 3 months later.  HP sent me back to Amazon.  I ask Amazon why are you selling me a used computer?  They don't know but immediately offered me a replacement or a refund.  I took the refund.  Even though the computer was working ok, I have some trust issues with Amazon.  They didn't even offer me a full 12 month warranty, said it started with the invoice.  So, I lost 3 months of warranty.  Sending it back tomorrow.  Sorry, Amazon. Needed a new computer to replace my previous aging Desktop. Wanted to give Ryzen a chance and after a few weeks I can say WOW this is great. This desktop while small does a lot and handles my daily apps with ease. It's about 95% faster than my old AMD dual core at everything and the GeForce video card is more than enough for anyone who is not a hard core gamer but that being said I tried 3 games all on ultra/epic settings and achieved 60fps, I believe anyone who doesn't game should still consider a desktop with a dedicated video card it frees up so much of your processor to multitask and increases system performance in so many ways. I am able to stream 4k instantly with no buffering issues. The 16gigs of ram is great the M2 hard drive while small can be upgraded but the 1TB drive is enough for most . I went ahead and added a 2TB so I have 3 internal drives with over 3TB of storage and had a additional 2 usb3 external 4tb drives that are converted to the usb3 port on the back. I am able to transfer files between any of the drives in mere seconds which is amazing considering how slow the old desktop was at transferring files between the drives. I would have loved to have just built a new pc but the current prices for video cards is highly inflated thanks to Bitcoin miners so for me this desktop fit my needs perfectly and is super quite in fact I almost wouldn't know it was running if it wasn't for the lights. I would recommend a new key board and mouse while the included devices get the job done I prefer  quality Keyboard and mouse that are full size for comfort. My boot times are around 30seconds from off to completely logged in and ready to jump onto the internet . Great choice for anyone needed an upgrade from an older pc",1,1
"The labels are very good to use on clothing for those in NURSING HOMES. The labels go through the wash extremely well. I had some to last over a year. They are easier to apply than trying to write a name in the collar. We use these to label my son's clothing for daycare. Babies tend to go through a few outfits a day, plus they grow out of clothes quickly. So I have to label a lot of clothes on a pretty steady basis.  I have zero desire to sew or iron on labels to all of his clothes. I found these labels and thought they would fit my needs perfectly. What a life saver! 250 kids at school with the exact same jacket??? At $20 a pop I'm not trying to buy another one! Soooooo glad i found these and def going to be sharing with all the other mums! i could not find these labels in any local store, and am very happy to find them on Amazon. I finally had the chance to give these chalk markers a try and I love them! I was able to blend the ink together while it was wet as an experiment and I liked the results! The ink flowed smoothly too! I may put a protective spray on it since I like this one. I was totally planning to only test it out, but I think I'll actually give it to my in-laws as a gift! I don't know how well these labels work yet as I just received them but the package arrived already opened and there was a label missing from one of the sheets. I would have asked for a replacement but I need to use these this week so whatever...one label less I guess. I bought these last year (the Martha Stewart version, also made by Avery) and just re-purchased them to label my son's bigger school uniforms. I really do think they work well, and 9 times out of 10 they last, wash after wash. I've had a few labels come off, but if you consider how many times I've machine-washed clothes with these labels over 10 months, as well as my younger son's ""nap bag"" items from his day care for the past 12 months, having three or four fall off is a very high success rate! The only downside is that they do leave residue on the rare occasion that the label comes off, but because I put a new label over where the old one is, it's not a big deal. On the oldest labels, the ink is a little faded, but nothing close to unreadable. I just use a regular black Sharpie (let the ink dry for a minute). I also don't put the labels on clothing and then wash. I wash first, then add the label so that they can sit for a while and adhere properly before being worn or washed. I bought these for a Girl Scout camping trip my daughter was going on. I labeled everything in case something was lost or left behind.  It's been months and many items have been washed multiple times,  and the labels still look great. Clothes, sleeping bag, pillow cases, blankets, brushes, toothbrush, water bottle and more were labeled, and they are all still looking great.",1,1
"Absolutely beautiful in person. She loves it! This ring is to substitute my real ring when I go out of town and to work. I feel wierd not wearing mine and didn't want to have to worry about harsh chemicaks at work or losing on a beach. My real ring is on the left/bottom. I ordered about 9 different rings before deciding this is the one to keep. I love it! My husband joked he should have just ordered one of these all those years ago! This ring is fabulous!!!! I read reviews on a lot of rings and I kept coming back to this one. I have lost a lot of weight and need to get my wedding set sized, but decided to do a CZ until I fork out a lot of money to do that. Love this ring, it looks so real, like a true colorful diamond, when the sun hits this ring and my real one they are exactly the same, except for the price...I work in a hospital laboratory and my hands are in all sorts of chemicals, and washed a thousand times a day with crappy anticeptic soap, I'd much rather wear this ring to work Got it on sale, great deal. My girlfriend loved it. I gave it to her as a promise ring. BE SURE TO FIGURE OUT HER SIZE THOUGH! I had to return one and get the next size up, but the process was simple and not difficult at all. When my Mom was younger she gave her diamond ring to my daughters boyfriend when he purposed to her. Now years later she has dementia, she forgot she gave it to my daughter so I bought her this one. It is almost a match to the one my Dad gave her. She was so happy she wanted one for the other hand. ( oh well if it makes her happy) Needless to say I ordered a second one. Both look great. It looks amazing. I was sceptical thinking the pictures were photoshoped or staged to look extra good, but they weren't. I received it today and it's beautiful. It looks expensive. And for being sterling, it has a good weight. I don't know how it will hold up, but it seems as though it'll last. The ring is very pretty in the box.  I would've preferred the center stone to be slightly larger, but I liked the setting and resisted being picky over an inexpensive and occasionally used ring.  I've worn it for 15-20 times at most, for only a few hours at a time, and have never done any amount of housework while wearing it, but the setting has become dull, scuffed, and scratched.  The sterling silver finish can't handle being worn with a plain wedding band.  If it had been $19 instead of $49 then I'd probably give it another star.",1,1
"I have a 6yr old niece who loves to show off and perform in front of the family so i knew this would be a great gift for her. I purchased the pink set. It's very lightweight and easy to assemble. I love that it comes with 2 microphones so 2 people can sing. The unit connects to any phone or device with an aux cord so you can sing along to your favorite songs. My niece is in love with this karaoke machine and the ehole family has had a blast with it. This makes a really great gift idea! I am a bit disappointed with how flimsy this is and the feedback from the mics, especially at the price point. However, my daughter seems to like it. She just cannot get to close to the speakers without it screeching. I would suggest looking at a real karaoke machine and comparing the prices before purchasing this. Package arrived damaged. Unit is made of cheap, flimsy plastic. But for fifty, not much else out there. I purchased this for my four-year-old grandson, he loves it!  The two microphones are great for playmates. Easy to assemble. Charge lasted several hours. It is sturdy, however, I would recommend if more than two kids are playing, use time limits!! granddaughter loved it This product is very cheap. very little, definitely not what I was expecting.  Ok for a toddler maybe, but any older than 5 I wouldnt purchase this one. It is was a birthday gift for my kids Exactly as expected. Our nieces loved the 2 microphones so they could sing together. Delivery was fast.",1,1

"In the past year or so, being outside in the cold has begun to bother my husband to the point he's almost ill when he comes inside -- and this is in the fairly temperate climate of Salem, Oregon. A warm coat and cap seem to only go so far. We bought a set of these silk thermal underwear to see if they might help. Well, they do! We've already ordered a second set, and are packing them for our winter visit with family in Iowa. I am buying more of these...my man loves them...and thinks they are far more comfortable than any other under garments for insulating purposes... A gift for my husband.  He loves them in the cold weather. Nice material but not V-neck as pictured and described. Absolute Nirvana brought for my son moving to NYC",1,1

"I bought the charging station because it was on sale. I only have 5 devices to charge but opted for this 8 USB port 2016 NexGadget charging station. It has been 22 days now since I have been using it and I still don't have any complaints. It comes with a 2.4A and 1A charging docks which is a plus for quick charging. The color indicators are helpful to let me visually know that the devices are charging. The removable clear plastic dividers make it convenient to stand or lay the devices down. The charging station is compact and worked well for our trips. I didn't have to keep track of my kids' chargers. This product is a great buy and I recommend it for parents like me who have young kids who lose and break their chargers often. Just what I've been looking for. This charging station can charge all my family's devices in one neat organized area. Works great and is exactly as described. 8 ports. I am currently charging an iPhone 6, Iconia 8 Tablet, Kindle Fire Tablet, Samsung S4, Samsung S5, 2400 Mah portable charger, 8000 Mah portable charger, and an LG Bluetooth Headset. I took a picture yet couldn't attach it.  This charging station is very slick! I have a lot of phones and tablets and other devices to church so it's nice having a device that can hold them all. Better yet, all the sections are big enough to hold any device I could want to put there. In others I've had to play tetris to get the devices in slots that would fit them, but not with this one! This does exactly what it promises, and the customizable shelves are terrific and surprisingly effective.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because of a few things that become annoying after use: Got this for couple days now and loving this charging station. Got rid of my old charging station that I had for almost 1.5 yrs now. Love the fact that this has total of 8 charging USB ports and 4 of them can actually carry 2.4 amp. Shorting my charging time for phones and iPad. More importantly the divider are great to organize the phones and tablets. The only problem i have now is the find short charging cable. Definitely an awesome charging station if you have phones and/or tablets. My husband is so hard to shop for.  This was a perfect early Father's Day gift to him.  My kids opened the amazon box, so he saw it and was wondering what in the world I had bought now, so I decided to hook it all up early, and HE LOVES IT!!  We have teens with phones and tablets.  While I think they need to stay current on technology, there is no reason why I would want my teens staying up all night or past a certain hour texting friends or snapping them or whatever.  Their friends should be sleeping, too!  So we have this battle over the need to charge phones, and no one wanting to do it in a public area because (sigh) cords and plugs disappear around here (we have 3 younger kids, too!). THIS charging station/dock has enough spaces to accommodate everyone's phones!!!!!  And tablets!!!!  And it is neat and tidy!!  I ordered a 4 pack of dual use short plugs:",1,1
"I have every variety of Saxx underwear. I wear a XL normally and a XXL in the ""modern fit"" styles. I have large thighs and have never had an issue with ride up with either the 6"" or 9"" inseam length until I tried these. They ride up fairly easily. The fabric is modestly thick wool, it's soft and the waist band is good. They are comfortable in colder weather, but definitely do not have the alleged cool feeling in hot weather. After a few washes they seem to be holding up well. i took the plunge and splurged on buying one pair. I have a lean, somewhat muscular build. The legs were a bit too big on this medium, despite that my 2 kinds of Banana Republic mediums fit well, as does another brand. I like this product; its high quality and comfortable. I would like to try a small, but I'm a bit too frugal to spend this much on a pair that may not fit well. Extremely comfortable. I was expecting life changing at this price... But I suppose that that is magical thinking. Still, I don't imagine that I'll spend this much on underwear again unless I win a lottery... Oops! I don't play lotteries. I was surprised how comfortable these are for outdoor activities like hiking and bicycling all day. Way better than cotton or synthetic and well worth the money. After multiple washes did not shrink or degrade at all. I like these, but they run a little small and fit tighter than the Platinum line. These seem to be well made. However if you have big muscle thighs expect them to ride up. They are comfortable, but I can't stand shorts that ride up! If they were longer that'd help. Amazing They are no better than any other underwear I have had (I was hoping for a really great pair of underwear. For me they are just your average pair of underwear with a large price)",1,1
"Just bought another because the one worked out so well. Seller was rude and lied. Said that if you pick the stand up, it will collapse, which is absolutely true. It does. But it's not SUPPOSED TO. Plenty of pictures from my peers online have pictures of this item being picked up. It's just a trashy version so it breaks!! Seller offered no help for me at all. Blamed me, but the item is junk. Get a brand name version and don't waste your money. I was gentle in picking it up! These are amazing.  They work beautifully with my GEL pens as well as my color pencils.  Thank you for creating a wonderful product!! I bought two of these and they're perfect for organizing the pens on my craft desk. I know some people have reported that the joining sections are rather loose/wobbly but I haven't had that problem- the connections slid in tight and the entire structure is very sturdy. It may be an issue of variable quality- if yours is wobbly, there's enough flat surface area on the joining parts that you could use an adhesive to get them stuck together. PERFECT for my needs. holds all my brushes and has enough room for me to remove them without knock them all over the place. I use this for my colored pencils (ones I'm using on the current piece I'm working on) also use these for holding my oil painting brushes while painting, I use for my pastel pencils also. I love these things as I clamp them on the right side of my drawing table for accessibility. So glad I purchased. Had to buy another and Will be buying yet another soon too. Useful on the workbench to store carving, cutting, filing, prying and marking tools.It comes as 6 pieces: base, grid top, and 4 corner posts. The assembles unit sometimes disassembled when pulling out a tool. Problem resolved after gluing the corner posts in place. I also added rubber cabinet bumper pads ( So this works really nicely and keeps things organized however the posts do tend to just fall off when you pick it up, so either be cautious when moving it, I have already spilled all my art supplies everywhere multiple times lol, or just glue it like I did!",1,1

"I love these bags normally but at least half of the bags in this order had a large slice down the middle of them. They were completely unusable. If you were unfortunate enough to not see the slit down the center of the bag, you figured it out when you essentially picked up dog waste with your bare hand. This is the first time I've ordered Bio Bags through Amazon and had I noticed the defect initially, I would have returned them. However, it wasn't until the last couple of boxes that we found the problem. I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews.  So far, all of my bags have been fully intact and hole free.  In fact, I find that these feel thicker and sturdier than many traditional plastic poo bags.  I'm a complete convert, and I will never go back to plastic. I love these waste bags! I live in an area that requires recycling/composting, so I am very mindful of how much I throw in the trash. Since these bags are eco-friendly, I feel better about throwing away these bags rather than normal plastic dog waste bags. Plus the handles are extremely useful. So it's a win win - my conscience is clear and it's actually easier to use than the regular bags on rolls. I know there are skeptics and cheaters out there, but these really are compostable. I did a test compost pile fed with poop-filled Biobags in a fence-wire open bin. Dog waste-only, and use of doggie compost, even finished, is not recommended on any food plants. I threw each bag in the bin and added layers of brown leaves or wood chips. Used the bin year after year and it never filled up, except in winter. The pile would then sink again as the weather warmed in spring. I took down the bins after five (or so) years. No poop, no smell. There were small bag remnants, but clearly most of the bags had broken down. I have loved using this biodegradable bag since I discovered them 8 years ago. The corn starch makes them more pleasant to have on your hand than thin plastic and they are dark so you don't have look at the contents. I can't believe how many plastic bags of poop sit in our landfulills.  Yuck! Since my dog passed away last year, I've been using them for the daily kitty litter scooping! These can be pretty expensive in the pet stor I like these bags and I haven't had any of the quality problems mentioned by some of the other reviewers.  However, there are few things that make this particular packaging of BioBags unappealing to me. While bio bags in general work really well, these are poorly constructed. I have had many bags split along the bottom/side seam after filling, leading to a useless bag and dog waste either on the ground or, worse, on me. I've tried lots of tricks to keep the bags whole holding them in the palm of my hand, flipping them over so the weight sits on the knot, but nothing works. At this point, I'm ready to throw away the rest of the box. Fortunately, they will biodegrade fast. I like these. I don't use a little holder but just tear them off and put a couple in my pocket. They have never arrived with tears or splits in them. They hold up well, even when a full bag is left in the rain. But they are way too expensive. I will try to find something cheaper and hope it has good features like this bag.",1,1

"These 3.9"" x 5.9"" static free bags do exactly what I need them to do– store 2.5"" laptop hard drives. I have various laptop hard drives with different heights (standard sizes are between 7mm - 9mm I think) and they fit just fine. The bags are a little long, but at least I don't have to struggle with getting them in.... now what do I do with the other 46 bags that I have left over? These products are excellent. I needed to store extra Laptop RAM and a WLAN Card and these worked great. They are so secured inside the package, they barely move when toting around! I will be ordering more when needed. I purchased these since I am upgrading several internal 3.5"" hard disk drives and I wanted an anti-static package to store the old drives in. I've tried many anti-static bags here on amazon advertised as being for HDDs. They were all disappointingly too small until I came across this brand.  (15x20cm/5.9X7.9inches) <- This size will comfortably fit a 3.5inch HDD. Do not get anything smaller than that for a 3.5inch. Great!  Sized as advertised.  Seem durable and of quality construction.  I am happy with the quality of the resealable ""zipper"" opening.  I can easily stick strips of masking tape to these, and they stay stuck -- to label the purpose of the drive.  (i.e. date of backup, which PC, etc). Nice bags.  Freshly manufactured and consistent in quality.  I've had a bunch of old discs knocking around for quite a while and it's comforting to know they are now well protected from from zaps and dust.  The somewhat rigid walls of these bags offer more mechanical protection than ordinary poly bags, so they might also be a good choice for jewelry, photos, and other slightly delicate items. Great for extra laptop ram sticks, mpcie/m.2 cards, perfect size.  might do okay with lga cpu also, but pga amd cpus will need more protection to keep the pins from bending. 50 is more than ill need, but it's nice to know i have a ton of spares to keep in a drawer.  no problems at all, and product quality is very good. much better than some ive recieved parts in before. The bags themselves are great, but I ordered 2 bags and each package only had 49 bags.  This wouldn't have hurt the review so much, except that I needed exactly 100 bags and I was 2 short.  This caused me issues, when I needed these last minute and paid extra for same day delivery.",1,1
"The one I purchased was a knock off from China. Duplicate cards, misspelled words. I've played the real game at a friend's house and this is not it! DO NOT BUY!  TERRIBLY MADE GAME!!!  Damaged box, no instructions, many repeat cards and tons of misspelled cards. I'm not sure what they hype is. It was cute but, well, glad we got it out of our system. weird and uncomfortable game came broken The game is really fun to play however this was not the original game but a knock-off version.  There were lots of  duplicate cards and even more cards with misspellings and phrases that didn't make sense which makes the game hard to play.  I recommend buying the game but not this version.  It also took a long time to receive it because it came from overseas. We got this game for my sister in law, we order an adult version and a family friendly one. We started playing the adult one but come to find out the cards some how got switched in the 2 boxes. We never opened them. Not to mention tons of duplicate cards which made the game horrible to play. We only got to use about 25 cards. I buy my Christmas presents early so it was too late to return.  Great game for adults. Challenging and fun. Didn't realize half of the mouth pieces were small and the others large. Didn't care about that, but if you specifically want larger ones, I'd recommend buying additional ones separately. If you play while eating, makes it even funner. 😉",1,1
"My husband goes through belts like water, which tends to happen when you're a large man who wears them beneath your belly and truly do use them to hold your britches up!  But I love the old guy dearly, and wanted to get him a nice one for Christmas (typically the inexpensive belts he buys come off of racks at a big box store.)  Wow, first impression is that this really IS a nice belt, and comes rolled up in a very handsome 5"" x 5"" x 2-1/2"" black box with nice design elements, that opens at an angle and has a silica gel packet inside.  Nothing quite like the aroma of brand new leather, is there? If you are a 36 waist I recommend going one size further and getting a 38. The 36 belt is just a little too small. It makes it, but you are either on the last or second to last hole which means if you gain any weight this belt won't fit. I plan on slimming my waist so this isn't an issue for me, but for people who might waiver one way or the other I could see this being an issue. The shade on this belt is also closer to tan than the color in the picture. It is probably about halfway in between. Looking at this picture, it is closer to where the light hits the loops The belt is good quality and comes in a very nice box, but the sizing could be better. I had received a size 42"" of this belt as a Christmas gift, and all the other belts I own are 42"" so that should have been the correct size. Granted, 40"" pants are a little snug on me, but not to the point that a 42"" belt would be too short. This one was too short. I could buckle it only on the loosest hole, but that made the part of the belt that goes under the loops only go under one of the loops. I ordered the same belt as a 44"" and that was workable but a bit long. What I really needed was a longer 42"" belt, comparable to all my other 42"" belts. Poorly made belt, had scratches and missing part of the black leather on portions of it. Would recommend finding real leather elsewhere, as this is clearly not as advertised. Belt quality appears good.  Not real ""cowhide"" type leather, but it'll do for the price.  SIZE !  I'm a 32-inch waist.  I wear a size 32-inch belt from another online merchant, let's say there's a couple of L L s in their name.  This belt-It says 32-inch waist, order 34.  Nope-doesn't fit, didn't fit, didn't come close.  I mean really - I came home from work, wearing a pair of dress slacks and belt.  Opened the box, looked at the belt.  Put in around my waist (through the belt loops!)  Nope - I can barely get to the first hole.  Just super undersized.  Returning.  Will try the 36-inch belt. Length was not as long as I would have liked by what I expected by the size I choose. The quality seems good though I have only had the change to use it but 3 times. ***Update... Marino was very quick to respond and send a replacement belt, the replacement belt was a size 38, my waist is a 34 and I had gone with what is the standard of one size larger than waist which was a 36 on my original order. I Like the belt but still recommend you make sure on the sizing as 38 is not 36. Updated August 28 2017:  Marino customer service was excellent. They admitted I received the wrong belt and sent me the correct belt at no additional cost.  The new, correct belt is very nice and exactly as described.  Original Review (2 Stars):  Belt received is not as pictured or as described. .Belt received was a Levi Strauss belt with a gaudy ""Levi Strauss"" engraved in the buckle.  Pictured belt is a dress belt with no engraving in buckle.  Belt pictured has stitching along both edges. Belt received is a simple strap of leather (no stitching) - more a casual belt for jeans.  Belt did not come in gift box as pictured.  Belt received is 1 1/2 inch wide.  Belt described is 1 1/8 wide. Perfect fit! Just remember to order your belt 2 inches larger than your waist size. If your a size 34 then order a size 36 belt...This belt has a great buckle that feels solid and like it will last a long time without being pulled from the leather. Its leather is the perfect stiffness for a belt. Not to stiff and not too soft. Happy i bought it!",1,1
"I love these pencils, great color selection!!!!! They blend really well. Perfect for my adult coloring books. Please please PLEASE Make a bigger set These are okay colored pencils.  They fall short when compared to Marco Raffine that I own.  The colors lay down well without using a lot of pressure to obtain good coverage.  They are a step above Crayola that I also own.  The colored pencils have a good range to choose from.  I like that the name is on the barrel along with a number as well.  There is a color key but unfortunately it is on the bottom of the tin which makes accessing it problematic unless you take out the trays or close it up and tip it over.  I have one pencil that has a cosmetic defect in, it seems only the barrel.  I reached out to the seller who upon my sending a pic of the barrel said I could return the set, receive a full refund and reorder.  For the sake of one pencil it would end up costing me much more than sacrificing this one pencil.  The seller did reply to my email very quickly.  Overall I recommend this set of colored pencils for everyday use coloring. Awesome colors, but the color keeps breaking in a few pencils. Nice and creamy pencils. I have been unable to use these pencils because of the odor. I received them for Christmas and took them out of the tin and put them outside to air out but it hasn’t helped They are as good as any other I have bought on here before Very nice pencils. Got these for 2 of my granddaughters for Christmas.  They love them!",1,1
"I took a risk on this product because of the maker. I was blown away buy the quality of the cookware. It is heavy, well made and beautiful. Way beyond expectations. I also bought some Cuisinart sauce pans because I never have enough sauce pans and a set always comes with the same pieces I don't need. Although the Cuisinart was well made, this set is several buts above. However I will keep the Cuisinart because I need the extra sauce pans. I will use all of this cookware. The Pros are the 7 layers of heat induction on the bottom. There are usable pieces here that work well together. There is a strainer that goes in the 3 quart pan. The picture shows a lid on the pan and the strainer but there is only one lid (which makes sense). This is also waterless cookware. I don't know much about waterless cookware but I have never seen a set for under $1000 so I never tried it. For the cookware alone, I would give it a 5. The negative side is around 4 of the parts. There are two trivets, and some handle with a suction cup. I have no idea what to do with these as the trivets are much too small to be of any use. I think the handle is meant to stick to the bottom of the mixing bowl so it can be used as a lid. Why, I don't know but that is the only thing I can think of. The strainer basket comes with a separate handle so the wire handle is considered part of the count. Next, the handles have plastic under them to make them cooler to the touch. There is a warning not to turn the flame up too high or they will melt. Yes they will because my husband turns the gas burners up too high and burned the handles on a similar pot I used to have. The knobs on all of the lids have temperature gauges built in. I have not had good luck with these kinds of lids in the past so for that reason (and the plastic under the handles) is why I am rating this a 4 out of 5. I get the impression there should have been a recipe book but an instruction guide would have really been nice. I have NEVER used waterless cookware so I am nor sure how to use this. Regardless, it meets my needs. Overall, I would value this set at closer to $1000 for the 15 parts I will use. You will not regret picking up this cookware! Well, we've been using this set for over three month and the first good impressions are melting away. We've had these over a year and they are horrible. The sad thing is we did a lot of researching it. Def sad over the purchase. LOVE IT ,LOVE IT ,=.........NICE ...BEST COOKWARE I SEE IN MY LIFE... THE COMPANY IS THE BEST THEY TAKE CARE MY ISUE WITH ONE OF MY ITEMS ..AFTER I OPEN MY BOX  ONE OF THE LONG HANDLES WAS BROKE ..I EMAIL...CONCORD COOWARE INC AND THEY RESOLVE MY ISUE WITH CARE AND THEY SEND THE ITEM THE  WAS BROKE WITH INSTRUCTION HOW TO DO IT .. AND I DID.... WAS EASY .. AS A WOMAN I HAVE TO SAID ... IM IN LOVE WITH MY COOKWARE....THANKS AGAIN FOR CARING ABOUT ME.. AND MY ITEM ......WELL IM GOIN TO COOK...SEE YOU ALL..:)..... ODETTE BOHNERT OF INDIANA The quality of this set is very good. Heavy weight and attractive as well. The thermometers on the covers are very helpful to make sure you don't cook on too high a heat. Very satisfied with my purchase. I like how this set cooks and have no problem with cleaning the pieces after use.  The down side for me on this set is, on the casserole pans, I get my fingers stuck between the opening of the handle and the pan itself.  Also, I find the edges need to be rounded under more.  I feel like I will slice myself on the edges.  I have yet but feel that it could happen. Have had these pans for a year and love them!  I bought these pans to use on my new induction stove top. I also wanted to replace my teflon coated pans and I took a while to get used to cooking on pans that were without the non-stick coating. These pans are the best I have ever used, are easy to clean, and this set pretty much is all you need.  I have made french fries and other deep fried foods by pouring oil in one of the medium sized pots and using the handy frying basket that comes with the set. These would make a wonderful  wedding gift. After using MAC this was quiet disappointing as the pan is not up to it and I was unable to replace it as an individual item...if anyone can assist I would like some feedback",1,1
"This a super sweet watch. It was hard to understand how to read the time at first. I had to atcually read the instruction to learn how to operate it.  A really good looking watch. The blue color looks great. The band is also stylish. The band is somewhat difficult to snap closed and to open. The clasp that locks it came off of mine. I was able to put it back on. You definitely have to be careful when opening the clasp. Keeping the price in mind the quailty is good. Really cool and eccentric watch. Once you get used to the odd layout, it's really easy to tell time. The steel band also looks and feels good. Hardest thing was adjusting the size so it fit perfectly, but you only have to do this once, so it's not that much of a problem. Unique looking watch face, just as easy to tell the time skinny blue band for hours and thicker band on for minutes. Easily change size on band using tool that comes with the watch, which also used to open the back of the watch. Easily a unisex watch has had compliments and inquiries from both sexes on where I found it. Never had a problem with the band pinching my arm hair but I did think the band is a little thicker than needed. I purchased this watch for my husband’s birthday and he loves it! It’s a nice looking watch. It was easy for him to program. The watch is easily adjustable to fit any size and comes with a tool to help adjust. It took a bit for him to see how the time was displayed but once you get it it’s simple. It is a bright display and the colors are just like the picture. I would highly recommend this watch for a husband, brother, son. This is such a cool watch. I bought it recently on an impulse urge and was afraid it would be confusing. It is really straightforward, and also has a good feel and weight to it. The band was adjustable, just a minor learning curb at first. Got this for my husband and he loves it. It didn't take him any time at all to read the slightly unusual display either. The color is a really nice bright blue. He has been wearing it for a while now and it is his favorite watch by far. The metal band is very nice, time is easy to set, and best of all it looks really awesome! Looks just like the pictures, and is not your average looking watch. Unique very interesting watch. A little strange at first to tell time on it but I like that most people seeing it on me will have their eyes drawn to it and not know what it is. Also a little difficult to adjust at first. Otherwise very sturdy and looks to be a long-lasting creative and fun piece.",1,1
"The vanilla flavor pudding isn't anything to write home about, but to be fair vanilla is rarely anything spectacular. The chocolate pudding however is to die for! It's rich, and creamy and has enough chocolate taste to curb even the most diehard chocoholics cravings. Plus, since they don't require refrigeration they make a handy lunch bag item(Or if you are a prepper, you can stick these in your emergency shelter...Even after a major quake or end of the world scenario, you might want some delicious tasting pudding on occasion.) Received this 12 pack of pudding (6 chocolate & 6 vanilla) 01/19/2018. The puddings have a Best by date of Dec. 3, 2018. Each pudding is one serving and consists of 100 calories. The protein amount per serving is negligible. The chocolate pudding has 120 mg of potassium. Of course there are healthier snacks, such as carrot sticks, grapes, cheese, applies, walnuts, etc., but these puddings have their place also. They taste good, have a long shelf life, are inexpensive, and store easily in your desk or kitchen pantry. Another of my Prime Pantry purchases for something to pack in my lunch box. I like the variety rather than 12 of one and the price was hard to beat. Once these are done and I need a snack to pop in the lunch box, I will be looking at these again. Pudding is great when you have two flavors, but Vanilla and Butterscotch would be an even greater flavor combo to combine. Just saying. The box came a little beat up when I got it with the rest of my stuff, resulting in some caved-in pudding cups. They didn't bust, so the appearance didn't really matter to me. They're classic Vanilla and Chocolate though, meaning that I ate all of the Vanilla and gave the leftover Chocolate cups to my siblings. Because Chocolate pudding is the worst. Variety packs are a MUST with kids. 6 vanilla and 6 chocolate ensures everyone gets the flavor they prefer.  Great price. Just now starting box 2, good for hurricanes or ts if you get flooding and stranded.  Wish they had those wooden spoons like you get with ice cream then could be car ready. Still fresh! Kept in pantry. Can be chilled also. Love pudding. We love eating these for snacks or using them for lunches. My husband is a big tapioca fan, i love chocolate, vanilla, pistachio, and butterscotch, my son loves chocolate the best. This is a great buy and great variety for everyone, fast shipping. Although the box looked good, upon opening it, EVERY cup was crushed on one side and upon opening the lid on the cup, the pudding was dried up  and shrunk in size.  Very poor- do not waste your money on something that immediately goes in the trash.",1,1

"This is my review of Micro USB Cables, 3-Pack, 3 Foot, by Xcord. I really like the look and feel of premium USB cables and it helps that they are available in convenient lengths. I like these 3 footers for charging on my desktop and they look so much better than stock cables. The jacket of these cables is braided nylon, which resists tangling and abrasion, and the ends are reinforced with aluminum shells that make inserting and removing the cables an easy, comfortable task. I have been testing a couple of different cables, both for my wife and I to have in the bedroom, living room and in the car as well as for a couple of friends that have been having problems finding good cables. These cables arrived and on the first inspection, they are built very well. The point where the cable meets the connector, the place most Apple cables fail, it very solid. Of course, ​the big test will be after I have used them for a couple of months. At that time if I have any problems I will log back in and update this review. I have a Bose Bluetooth speaker & damaged the charging cord, so I ended up throwing it away. You can never have to many chargers especially when your animals like to chew on them. I bought these because we only have one left in the house now and i don't won't to risk it. They are the perfect length and are made of nylon material which I love and think last longer. Both ends of the cords are put together very well and they don't look like they will fall apart anytime soon! I am really rough on my USB cables and decided to splurge and go for these higher quality cables and I couldn't be happier. These work great and look good as well. One unintended benefit is that I always know which cable is mine at work when I loan it out. Saves me from accidentally giving away a cable. These are nice and stuff and I expect them to last for quite some time. Bought this a couple of weeks ago and I’m writing a review because I am so happy with this purchase. It charges just as fast as the iPhone cord that came with my iPhone but this is better not only because it’s cheaper but because it has this braided material that looks super sturdy and durable so I know this will last me for a long time. I recommend this product. these are very sturdy corded chargers.  usb so they can charge your device anywhere and they fit nice and snug in the charging port.  I love the cool sleek black and silver looking cord. These  are very nice quality cords. Really solid and sturdy, and can get a ton of use out of them.  Don't break right away like your typical cord you would pick up at the retAil store.  I really like how it's braided around the cord. It charges your phone very fast. This is really a great product",1,1
"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product; vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa. Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year. Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though. Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the ""Fabric Case"" for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe. This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again. Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it! I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot.  I was expecting a snug fit; however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case.",1,1
"Very comfortable shoes!! Love them!! There is some heal slippage but the fit and feel were so good i wanted to figure out a way to keep them. If you Google heel slipage, there is way to the them that stops the slippage without putting added pressure on the top of your foot. Lots of cushion, sleek look with jeans. Not to big, I ordered my regular size 8 Comfortable shoes Design and look Very nice looking. My Christmas present. Can't wait to wear them HOHOHO A little bulkier than I like. Still comfy and stylish.",1,1
"These rings are very pretty but unfortunately, one of the rings came broken. Three other rings were welded/put together oddly. I bought these rings to secretly find out my mother’s ring size. Otherwise, very pretty. Love these! Just like the the picture and they come in a cute little bag to keep them nice! They turn so fast. Green fingers not worth it. I purchased both the Star and the Bohemian set. I didn't know quite what to expect as far as quality but as a prime member I didn't have much to loose. These are surprisingly nice! The only reason my rating isn't five stars is that they came really late, like a week after they were supposed to. I have relatively fat fingers, but all the rings fit very well! Five of them were rose gold, and the other five were just plain gold, but you can wear them all mixed together and not really tell the difference. They haven't tinged my fingers green, and I've had them for about a month now. Very good for the price! I got these for my daughter. She loves them. They haven't turned her fingers green yet. Within two hours of wearing, there were stones falling out. I knew the rings were cheap, but I had hoped they’d last a bit longer. Listen to other reviews. I love the way these look and the way I was treated. Very professional! Thank U and you have a loyal customer from now on! Brody",1,1
"For a work computer with 2 monitors it does really well. Mine came with windows 10 freshly installed. What this meant is there was 2 massive updates. It crippled the computer's ability to do much. Took 2 entire days to do the 2 updates. After everything installed the computer is pretty snappy and does well with multi applications open. I don't know how this computer would be for a gaming computer. excellent bang for the buck. Fast (3.9ghz in turbo mode adjustable from the ASUS pop up menu...)' reliable, lotsa storage. Had high expectations about Asus computers but this one was dead on arrival and had to send back.",0,0

"***Update*** Added video from snorkeling in Hawaii.  I could only upload one video and Amazon reduces the quality of videos so it’s not the original quality by far!  I uploaded it to show the field of view and show how it does underwater with nothing but the camera.  Your videos will look much much better. Great camera for the low price! I bought this camera because I was going on a cruise to the Bahamas with some friends and I wanted to be able to take some pictures and videos while we were in the water and also while snorkeling. I did not want to spend the money on a GoPro because I knew I would not be using the camera often and I did not need all the bells and whistles that the GoPro offers. Just give me something I can take in the water and make cool videos with lol. The camera also takes good pictures outside of the water as well and I got many good shots. Since you are only paying $70, I would not expect the same quality as a GoPro or other high end camera (let's be realistic) but it gets the job done! The camera came with many different attachments, but I mostly used the ""selfie stick"" (although I wish there was a button on it that would take the pictures instead of me having to use the burst mode, but no big deal!). Make sure you buy a memory card because the camera does not come with one, I bought a 32gb for only $18 and it has plenty of space for videos and pictures. All in all I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take some good pictures and videos without having expertise in photography and does not want to pay the high price for a GoPro. This camera was great for me because I didn't want to spend the money for a Go Pro, but wanted something with similar functions that  I used this for underwater pics and video (mp4) in a pool and they came out super clear ! I also used this to inspect roof shingles on a camera pole and it worked great.. This camera creates a wifi hot spot that you can connect to it through your phone app. You can see what your camera is seeing on your phone and take photos or video directly from the phone. Im not sure about the range, but i used it at least 25 feet on a camera pole and it had no problem connecting to my phone. I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter for Christmas and shes absolutely in love with it. Shes taken some absolutely gorgeous video of the fish in our pond with it. I think shes dunked it into every body of water she can get to so she can video tape those ""hidden worlds"". It really does let you see whats down there in a way you just can't experience other wise. The fish don't panic from it and the images are clean and clear. Much easier to understnad than my GoPro 3 although it is more simplistic.  Amazing value for the money. I highly recommend one of these as you get quite a few accessories on included with the big boys; i.e. back pak, handle, cases, etc.  Go ahead make the plunge and grab one of these for under $75  I was easily able to get the Bluetooth connection established.",1,1
"I thought these shoes were going to be great. They look great and they fit really well, but then every single time I took a step there was a portion of the sole that with suction to hard floors and make a pop sound when I walk. Embarrassing and annoying! Had to return. I want to reorder and hope it was just something wrong with that particular shoe but I've gotten no reassurance from the company and that that is the case. Fit of these shoes is great - the bungee ""laces"" have just the right amount of tension and the shoe is pleasantly lightweight. Unfortunately, these are the NOISIEST shoes EVER! There is a lattice-type pattern on the bottom of the shoe that results in a suction noise every time you step on a hard surface. It's reminiscent of the Spongebob Squeaky Boot episode. The noise is driving me C-R-A-Z-Y. It's loud enough that coworkers have started poking fun...oops! I purchased these for my mother-in-law.. she can't really tie her own shoe laces anymore and with the memory foam,stretch-to-fit, and slip-on.. these are just perfect for her. They are light weight and have good traction. We haven't noticed the annoying suction noise that a few others have complained about but as far as comfort and fit goes... they are great and the price isn't bad either. Love love love these! I work in a lab and spend time on my feet all day, these are great and comfy. Unlike way too many sneakers on the market they also don't stand out as ridiculously unfashionable on the NYC subways, which is exactly what I was going for. Have held up forever too! Bought these as an inexpensive replacement when I hurt my back and needed more support than my shoes that had begun to lose their squish. Very light, don't have to bend to tie any laces (just elastic string keeps them on) and fairly comfortable to wear at work all day where I spend a significant amount of time on my feet. I ordered my usual size and they fit as I expected. I was concerned for a while because it seemed to have thin ball support.But I went outside and started walking through rough pavement. Sturdier than I thought but it's like walking over marshmallows. I'm going to see if they have these in different colors. :D I love everything about them except the noise they make when I walk on tile floors - sounds like a suction cup.  The comfort makes them worth the noise. Best sports shoes I've purchased in a long time.  The bungee chord isn't too loose or too tight, and I don't have to worry about shoe laces coming undone.  I'm purchasing another pair.",1,1

"I love my shirt !!!! There was a small error in the stitching of the top, they were SOOOOO FAST to contact me back, and had a tracking number for a new one before I could even finish saying thank you! The top is so comfortable, I can’t wait for my new one to wear out to Church and will add a photo of it too. I am really so satisfied with the customer service, definitely above and beyond and they truly care about their clients!!! I will order more from them ! I love the shirt, it is just not very true to size.  Runs small Nice quality. Shirt has some stretchiness to it, which was unexpected but it's ok.  Returning because print is too far to the left.  When my arms are down you can barely see the end of the words. I would buy again if alignment could be fixed. Ordered L/XL based on reviews. Could have gotten M. Grandaughter picked this out... happy w/ quality.. after reading some of reviews I ordered up a size for her.. looks like that was wise choice Love this one but no other color.. wish there was a bright green or an aqua blue color.. It fits awewome! I'm 5 5 and 200 lbs it's prefect! Thanks to Prime, shirt came in good time. The color doesn’t appear as red in person, more of a dusty pink. I ordered mine according to the US size small and it fits just fine. It is wider, but I tied the bottom as pictured and it looked cute. The shirt is short and wide. Not at all what I expected.",1,1
"This tablet is loaded with features. It has a nice size keyboard where you can actually type papers and letters on a web based word processor. The processor is *very* fast, and there is no wait. Sound is very nice and loud enough to actually hear uTube videos. Lots of buttons to control the tablet in nice locations. I get 5 hours battery life watching uTube videos. It has android 6, which it is very slick and smooth. I was able to take my phone info/settings and transfer to the tablet seemlessly. I connect via wireless and it has not lost the connection from usage all day and night; mostly watching video. Where I work, everybody has a tablet. Out of the 50 or so tablets, this RCA tablet is faster, nicer, and cost 1/2 as much Basically it's a computer with a big screen but it is light weight! It is easy to start up and running when you get it ad works great! It has a USB port and the tablet is detachable from the buttons! It is also touch screen! HERE IS THE BEST PART: WHEN YOU CHARGE THE TABLET IT CHARGES THE KEYBOARD AT THE SAME TIME! The laptop is well built and a bit heavier than similar sized laptops. The performance is good. Internet surfing speeds are good, and 25 Gb of internal storage is enough for most people. The ability to remove the screen and use it as a tablet adds versatility to the product, which is nice. The 11"" screen is nice. Sure, the resolution is a bit lower than other laptops, but it's really not noticeable. There is a learning curve to the touchpad, however. There is no ""click buttons"" on the touchpad, so ""touch and hold on the lower left side of the touchpad"" is used in its place. Once you get used to that, it's not much of a problem. Still, a wireless mouse might be a necessity if you can't get used to it. The speaker is the low point of this laptop. Headphones or a bluetooth speaker would definitely help. I use headphones when videochatting. Without them, it's hard to hear what the other person is saying. Sure, it has a couple shortcomings, but for the price, it's a good, solid laptop. Battery life is amazing, and it'll go four or five hours before needing a charge. Keep in mind, it's NOT a top end laptop. But for $100.00 you get a serviceable Android laptop that also pulls double duty as a tablet. Charging is done via the included charging cable, or via micro USB. A nice touch. I was a little skeptical about if i wanted to keep this tablet when i received it.  after a few days of using it, i decided i like it.  the buttons are large enough to type fast and it has all the features and more than I expected.  i purchased it because my Acer Chromebook took a dump after 1 year.  I use it for checking email, surfing web, and purchases from my favorite online stores.  I like the touch screen feature that my Chromebook did not have.  I don't play video games, but many games are available to download from google play.  I am a happy customer. aWESOME,STURDY,UNIQUE ANDROID TABLET/PC.And the price is AWESOME for the quality that you get! The pictures dont serve justice just to as sturdy,and qulity this product is...Fast!! We bought this for our children to use for homework. It has been great. Works for everything they have needed it for. They have also enjoyed watching movies on it. Only downside is you have to use Google Docs with it, but once you get familiar with that program, it's great. Great little tablet for the money (bought new for $97 in early 2017). This is a great tablet...so far. I love the keyboard that is attached to this tablet. It's the best keyboard so far I have seen in any tablet. You can easily remove and reattach the keyboard and use the screen as a regular tablet. Full USB port also on this tablet...very rare to find in a tablet and I like that. Mouse pad in the front center area of keyboard....just like laptops....very nice! Pretty speedy, decent picture quality and battery life at least 5 hours long. It appears I can use this tablet with the AC adapter plugged in at the same time. Really a great basic speedy tablet. It has Android 6.0 and quad core processor also. This tablet does it all for me just great!",1,1

"Good quality. Looks pretty good on my hand. I bought it for my eighteen-year-old daughter as a gift. Very elegant, it's nice to look at the hand. She was very pleased. The delivery was very fast. I am very pleased and advise this product. UPDATE:  I had a slight problem with the clasp being loose. Requested a new clasp and was PROMPTLY sent an email promising a full new watch. I said I only needed the claps and (in fairness) I bent my into place with pliers in the meantime, and they said ""no problem, it's already mailed, make it a gift. Above and beyond expectations!!! I needed a silver watch that could be dressy enough for a wedding, but I didn't want to spend a fortune. This watch was perfect. I love the size of the watch face, easy to read. The design is very simple, but elegant. I haven't worn a watch in years, but when I saw this one on sale, I wanted it. And now I haven't taken it off. I wasn't going to purchase it, having read some of the reviews that say it's cheap and stops working quickly. But I'm glad I did, because it's still ticking a month, on. Maybe those customers just got the odd defective ticker. This watch looks nice and is a good size. The silver wore off pretty quickly, but I wear it 24/7 and I'm a nurse so I wash my hands 30 times a day. I wear it in the shower too and it still runs just fine. For the price it's a nice piece of jewelry! I love this watch.  It is beautiful and goes well with whatever I am wearing.  I definitely will recommend this watch to my friends. I am really in love this watch! It is small very simple,  nothing too flashy or over the top but it gives the perfect look and touch to everything exactly what I was looking for! It's also at an amazing price for such a beautiful watch! I wear it everywhere, everyday and I am stunned at the compliments I get from my friends or even strangers! It's simply a beautiful,  comfortable watch to wear and on top of that it's water resistant! Thanks for the great product!",1,1
"A good basic tee, soft and well-fitted. A little long which I particularly like. Good for the price and basically what I was looking for. Ordered the hard to find brown one size up in large.  It is chocolate brown as pictured and not see through at all, wearing pink underneath and doesn't show.  I am 5'5, 150 lb, normally size 8 top.  The large was a good fit.  I normally stretch the sides of tshirts to get some forgiveness for the menopause middle.  Lots of lycra in this one, stretched out but returned to near original shape.  So if you like close fitted this is great.  But expect rolls to show or go another size up.  I can't go up because the shoulders will be too big.  Looking at the vneck border, there may be some uneven fading, so definitely wash on delicate.  Good basic for a color I can't find at major retailers. I'm 5'9"" and have a hard time finding shirts and blouses long enough for my tall torso. I ordered this v-neck in black based on the good reviews, and PROBLEM SOLVED, EVERYBODY. It's well-made and fits so beautifully, I immediately ordered two more in different colors (jade and heather grey). Bonus: I was pleased to find that the heather grey tee was not see-through, a big issue with v-necks from The Gap, Loft, etc. I ordered two in sizes 2XL based off of the reviews and the sizing chart. The taupe and oasis. Both shirts are two totally different fits. The oasis is perfect and the color is spot on. The taupe is like two sizes bigger yet marked the same size and has a soft yellow color to it. I 100% could have gotten away with XL, possibly L if I wanted them to be super fitted, but I wanted more comfort and flattering without worrying about the size label on it. Both shirts have different brand names on them too? Whatever.. still great shirts! Super soft, comfortable and the sleeves are perfect length, not too short where my chicken wing arm fat is hanging out. I am normally a Medium and I am 5'11"" tall with a narrow waist. I have ordered this shirt before so I knew sizing ran small in fit (it is the PERFECT length for me) I ordered a Large....I have not tried the Medium, but I anticipate that it would be very tight. The Large was comfortably snug without being skin-tight. Normally I drown in a large, especially at the waist. This is an amazing shirt, especially for tall gals like me. The fabric is NOT THIN or see-through either. Nice and thick and soft. PERFECT. I have one in 5 different colors. Love this shirt - the fit was great and the fabric was really soft. For reference I bought an XL and I usually wear a L or XL & a 36D. These tshirts were exactly what i was looking for. Great quality for such a low price. I'm 5'10, 145lbs and the size medium fit me perfectly. The length hits right at the hip, which I love. It fits exactly how it looks on the model. I would definitely recommend the purchase. I plan on buying several more colors. Great closet staples. This shirt is tiny tiny-would fit a small child. I even went up 2 sizes bases upon the reviews-yet, still this ""Large"" shirt is very very very small. I'm so serious too. If you want to wear a skin tight shirt and let your boobs hang out-then YES this shirt is for YOU!! I'm a 34B, 120 lbs 5'3'' and I could not get this shirt over my head-My husband had to help pull it off of me too because  I was choking to death trying to get this baby shirt off. I almost died doing so. Again, this (wink wink) ""Large"" shirt is tiny tiny. Would fit a very small child. Prob 4 years age.",1,1
"Good product and best result...my eyelase a bit tick  after one week using....and soo happy try for hair and have positif result too...and good price..thanks Item wrapped nicely to prevent breakage, its well received. looking forward to use this item mixing with other product for hair care. Castor oil is known to have certain health remedies and one of them is remedy for knee pain. Have yet to try it, hope it works! Good buy.  1st time using it. Need more time to see if it's effective in keeping scalp healthy and promoting hair growth, including eyebrows! Promotes hair growth.  Results can be seen after one use! Castor oil is naturally thick, sticky and doesn't have a pleasant scent so I mixed it with fragrant coconut & almond oil and it wasn't as thick and it the scent was heavenly!  Used it on brows & lashes too!   love this product!!!",1,1

"OVERALL: Good toy that gets children moving, keeps their interest through electronic interactive music, cheering, and instructions. Although it's a sports center, it only features basketball and soccer. 6 month son loves this. His daddy is a basketball player and now so is he! The sports center is actually bigger than what it may appear online (check dimensions) but this is a pleasant surprise as often it is the other way around, right? I got this for my son's 1st birthday, and he loves it. I wasn't even done putting it together and he was trying to play with it. It is very easy to put together by the way, it pops together and you just put in a few screws. It needs 3 AA batteries that do not come with it. It has a sensor on it so if they throw a ball in the basket, or into the soccer net it will count and cheer them on. It comes with a soccerball and a basketball, and they are good sized so no choking hazard with those. But there are some small pieces that snap on to the toy as well, like 3 gears. Really entertaining to watch my son play with it...I'll be honest, I played with it too. I was somewhat disappointed to see the height of the basketball hoop.  I didn't think about it at the time but it wound up being less than chest-high on my (admittedly tall) 2-year old nephew.  By the time the toddler is old enough to understand and appreciate how to use this, it's a little small.  Still a fun toy overall but he may not get too many months of fun with the toy. I love this toy but more importantly, so does my son! I got this for my 20 month old and he is obsessed with the soccer and basketball ball toy this comes with. He will just put the balls in the hoop over..and over... and over! We all know that with most toys, kids will not stay interested for long. We have had this toy for three months now (it was a xmas gift) and he still enjoys playing with it. My son also loves to see the numbers flash on the screen because he will say the number. Putting the toy together was super easy and simple, just make sure you buy the required batteries because this toy does not come with them. I have a small living room and I'd say it does not take too much space. This game center for kids is fantastic.  There are tactical, auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to engage kids and make play fun.  The product is well built and relatively easy to assemble, especially when arriving in Amazon's frustration free packaging.  The unit also comes with two balls, a basketball and soccer ball, that are toys in and of themselves.  I would highly recommend this sports center! Add this to the list of must have baby toys. NEVER would have thought to get something like this usually, but my 20 month old daughter LOVES THIS. All the kids place with it (ages 20 months through 9 years) It keeps the baby's attention more than any other toy. Even when she's not playing with this, she plays with the soccer ball and basketball on their own, though she only likes to play with actual set if it's turned on. My 10 month old is still too young for this toy, but I couldn't resist taking it out of the box and setting it up when I ran across it while doing my spring cleaning.  He loves it! He still cannot walk, but he enjoys crawling up to it and making it sing him his abc's! I am very pleased with my purchase, I plan on getting more vtech products in the future.",1,1
"Pretty much what I was looking for--high fiber, a decent amount of protein, and low sugar. I'm not using these as meal replacements, though you could; rather, I am using them to add protein and fiber to my diet. These work very well for that. This bar has all the good stuff that you need: I like that these bars are really low in sugar but they don't have sugar alcohol.  Quite filling.  I will certainly buy again and again! These are great energy bars!  Very low sugar and I like the fact they have probiotics.  Fibre amount is amazing too. Great taste, great before and after a workout. Definitely worth a try. ""Great bar! tastes like apple pie. I like to grab one on my way to work"".",1,1
"Looks great!! Good quality. Better price than the cheap belts at Target. I will order another for my son for when he forgets his at school. Truly is reversible. He wears size 10-12 and the 28 fit in the smallest hole with plenty of room to grow. I bought the belt because I have a 29"" waist & needed a reversible one. I did get the 29"" belt & put it on notch 3 I think & have about an inch of belt that sticks past the belt loop. This was a plus because there isn't excess belt. I may have gone with the next size up though. If you're an adult & using this, just remember that the width of the belt is smaller. For the price I paid, it's just fine. My son measured at a 24 waist and we got the 26. It fit him on the first notch (the tightest fit) with room to go 👍🏼. After having this belt for over 5 months its still the same . no issues with the buckle...I love the easy of just pulling up and twisting the buckle when  changing between the two colours. My son loves it .....even though I purchased it a little bigger ....just get the additional holes inserted and it's good to  go! Bought this belt twice. It seems like a really nice belt but it broke after several months of use. I bought it again because I'm hoping the other was a fluke. Fit my son great and was easy for him (7yrs old) to change the brown to black. Looks kindof cheap and color is alot lighter in person. NIce belt, and I love that it is reversible - it goes well with my son's black pants and khaki pants! =)",1,1

"We love Tide. It's one of the only detergents that no one in my family is allergic to. I really love the pods. It's super convenient, and even my 10-year-old son can do laundry because he can just toss one in. I really appreciate the various scent options, especially the febreeze ones. Also the price is very comparable to the liquid. But with none of the mess or trying to get the last bits out of the bottle. I'd have to be hard pressed to go back to using the liquid. Like the product a lot.Don't listen to Procter & Gamble recommendation of two or more per load. Our LG washer only gets one per load and clothes come out very clean. May be more expensive than powder or liquid but way more convenient. I have never been interested in these until our washing machine detergent feeder broke. I thought it was kind of lazy to use them. I mean who can't measure out detergent?  But when our machine no longer fed the detergent into the drum we decided on these. I don't know what I waited for. So stinkin easy, our problem is fixed, and a bag lasts forever. Originally the same price as the store so the only plus was fast shipping so I didn't have to go out to get them.  When I bought these Amazon had a $3.00 coupon so that made it cheaper than the store so a better value. I love these things in this particular scent. I feel like they're part of my signature smell at this point in my life. These pods work every time and keep me from pouring too much detergent in. It's pretty hard to mess up laundry in this day and age. Thank you, Tide. I've been using Tide Pods for years now in my super duper front loading ""space capsule"" that works like a robot!!! It is just so easy to throw a pod into the tub and go. Now fuss, no muss with powder! Love them!!! Roll Tide!!! This is a very good product at a great price. Gets washes clean but I also pair with oxy for max effect.",1,1
"I received this suit in less then four days. The fabric is beautiful and soft. The suit is slightly darker then I expected, but stil a great looking grey suit. The price is right and the look is sharp. I will most likely purchase another suit from them. I took it to my local tailor here in Seattle and had the jacket and vest brought in slightly to fit my shape and had the pants hemmed. All alterations were only 65. I think this is a great price for a great looking three piece tailored suit. I am 5'6"" 118LB and I bought the 34 short. The suit fits perfect, the quality is nothing fancy but for price its awesome! I will be buying more suits later! Not bad! perfect fit ! good price the only issue is that the thigh and calf areas are too tight I love this suit!  I'm 6'4"" 190 lbs and it fits great.  People are constantly complimenting how nice this suit is.  I highly recommend all of these suits. Very nice For the price it is great. Overlly shiny and obviously a cheap suit but the price is right",1,1
"Got this product as a gift for my wife. It lasted 3 months and completely came apart with minimal use (one-two times a week).  I am disappointed at having spent close to $75/- on this shoe! These look fantastic! Plus, they are really comfortable. I thought they would be too large when I first put them on, (even though I ordered my standard size) but as I wore them throughout the day, they seemed to fit my feet better and better (possibly my feet swelled a bit as I’m on them about 16-20 hours a day). The calves are rather snug despite being wide-calf, but there’s just enough stretch that I suspect they will relax with more use - they aren’t too snug as to inhibit motion or cause constriction. No regrets with these. I love these boots!!..I have bought tons of boots and this is,the first pair that has felt sooooo comfortable when I first pur them on....they are soft , not hard and stiff....the fit is,perfect everywhere.....They look great...im going to buy another it few more pairs of these,in other colors too....extremely happy! Love the boots but they run a tad large.  Ordered my usual size 8.5 and am quite sure I could wear an 8 comfortably and if I had the chance, would try a full size smaller.  That being said, it's good for wearing thick socks!! Nice looking boot, which really upsets me. Would give 5 stars if they fit According to the sites measurements. I went with an 8.5. My foot measures 9 1/2 so with socks I figure 9 3/4 would be perfect.  Once i received the boots, my 8.5 measured almost 11 1/2 in the sole. I realize the inside is not as big but it's also not much smaller.  I had over an inch past my toes. Not sure how to gauge what to order now. I love these boots. I am lucky I have very narrow feet because these boots are extremely narrow. They hold up well and look great. I highly recommend for those with skinny feet. I received these boots as a gift from my husband. The fit wonderfully.  They are true to size and slide right on. I am 5'4"" and the fit my leg right up to my knee without rubbing on the popliteal space. My calf is 14.5 inces in circumference and this boot fits great. These are the cheapest looking boots,  they are cute and you get what you pay for.  Keep that in mind.  They are not leather.",1,1
"It was exactly as I expected and the product shipped rocket fast !!!! VERY SATISFIED ! The light is bright but it is very difficult to turn off and on.  It works, but when you want to turn it off, and back on again it is challenging.  I have  bought from other companies and the off and on switch was big and simple.  This is a little tiny lever that one cannot see or find very easily, and most certainly cannot work with any gloves on. Bought this for my husband! I got this for my stepdad for Christmas and he loves it!  He uses it to walk the dog at night, it is so much easier than carrying a flashlight. It's great to have both hands free. This should be a safety hat, if you are walking in the dark or working you need this, if you you fall you need both hands to try to catch yourself. This beanie fits nice and snug, not loose like other caps I've tried (it's windy where I live), the LED's are bright and easy to turn on/off while the hat is on your head. I highly recommend this hat to the others on Amazon, and I have tried out a few. This item arrived exactly as  described. Seems to be of good quality. I bought this as a gift, so I haven't used it myself. I did try it out and it worked fine. Works great for night time grilling!!!",1,1
"Would give it 5 stars for looks and sturdiness. 4 stars for lack of good assembly instructions (just a diagram) and the center hinge not functioning like it should (lid doesn’t want to close completely). I’ve put a ton of furniture together, so I was able to figure out exactly what went where... familiar with the kind of hardware provided. The center hinge that’s designed to follow the lid up and down (no finger slamming) does that job very well, but it’s like it’s a little too long for the closed position. It makes the rear panel bow out a little, and leaves the lid open about an inch. I have to forcibly push the back panel in to get it to close all the way. I’m hoping the hinge will loosen up a little over time. Sturdy enough to hold a 6 foot 2 inch, 205 pound man sitting on it while putting his shoes on.  Holds approximately 9 pairs of size 14 triple E shoes.  Assembled in minutes, I used gorilla glue to hold tight the cams and dowel rods.  The color might be a little shiny for some but overall makes a good solid, entryway shoe box/chest. I purchased this as a fashionable discreet toy box for my nephew, but realized while assembling, that it could also serve nicely as a comfortable coffin for small to medium sized, beloved family pets when they cross over the rainbow. Attractive and versatile! Nice and big...great price. Seems to be sturdy and roomy, yet the resistance on the hinges seem to be too strong for the lid, so the screws that hold on the hinges are coming out. Very nice and easy to put together. It’s a little darker then I thought it would be but still looks greats! Looks great in the living room. Easy to assemble. Beautiful and sturdy.",1,1
"Colors and material are just as pictured and comfy. I have a size 41 hip circumference & they were too small though .. the waist band was significantly tight as were the leg holes on my thighs .. if those were a tad bigger they would have fit perfectly Nice... No binding or riding up the behind. Very nice undies. But runs a little small but then could be because I’m a plus woman. Would recommend them. Way too small but the material seemed nice. Probably should’ve ordered two sizes up. Fits are good. But upon opening package they smelled weird. Wash before wear of course just didn't expect the stench. I had to constantly keep pulling them up. Returning because they are too small, but otherwise they are awesome!  Can't re-order because they are out of stock!  bummer! The under is very comfortable. Is right size that I want it. Many color and after one wished it fell comfortable",1,1

"We purchased a Samsung top-load washer with pre-treat basin which requires HE liquid.  This is the cream of the crop.  It takes a small amount to wash a full load of jeans, less for lighter materials.  While it looks to be pricey here understand that a bottle like this will last well over a month of washing almost every other day.  At least that's our finding.  It doesn't leave your washer stinking, but you should keep your lid open to dry out between washes anyway- This does not have a strong perfume scent like major brands out there.  It is gentle for sure- so I'm not smelling like a blast of flowers in a meeting at work. I use a fraction of the soap I was using with the grocery store brand and our clothes are clean and fresh.  Its pricey, but based on how much of the product you use per load this bottle will last a couple of months at my house and we do laundry daily.  There are 4 people in our house, with 2 kids (3 and 5). This type of detergent came with our new front-load washer. For decades we'd been using powdered detergent. But a very small amount of this liquid detergent goes a long way. Clothing comes out clean and we spend about 1/2 as much per year on detergent. Make sure you get the small transparent dispenser. We love this detergent. It's low foaming and cleans our clothes awesome. It's much more concentrated than the detergents you buy off the shelf at the stores and has a nice light scent. This lasts us quite a long time and we will buy this from now on vs any other detergent. Excellent detergent.  It has no animal bi-product that can cause moldy smelling clothes.  I use this (concentrate) which you only use a small amount of along with a cup of white vinegar with each wash.  It cleans my machine and my clothes smell so fresh. I’ve been using this for about a year. I love it and wont use any thing else. Cleans well, nice clean light scent, lasts much longer because you only use a small amount. Great for front loader HE. My favorite detergent. Get clothes clean, removes odor, and you only have to use a tiny bit. This bottle will last up to 4-5 months. We bought a bottle in December and it lasted 6 months. I love this detergent, light scent, no static (no need for fabric softener!) low suds and gets our clothes really clean.  Never want to use anything else again.",1,1

"AMAZING! Quality way beyond expectations. These look as nice and solid as my much more expensive 14k hoops. VERY IMPRESSED! Just received these in the mail and they are super cute very easy to open as there's a hinge, but I found it quite difficult if you have multiple holes in your ear to put the earrings on as the stem of the earring is so curved you have to fiddle with it in order to get it through the piercing. That was kind of frustrating for me as I have several holes in my ear but I was able to finally get it through, they seem to be secured as when you close them you hear a click ensuring they won't fall off. Hopefully these will last a while. I was amazed how cute & comfortable these little earrings are. I have had them in for a couple weeks, even sleeping in them, and no issues. I have a high sensitivity issue with metals, so I can't wear most costume jewelry. These must be a high quality stainless steel, because I haven't had any issues at all. I would definitely buy from this company again. Oh, these are very tiny earrings, so if you have either super long ear lobes or really thick ear lobes, you may have issues with them. I have two sets in my ears now, one in standard piercing position & one in standard upper piercing position. They would most likely work great in cartridge piercing position or even in more creative piercing positions (trying not to get too grafic Incase of younger viewers reading this). Bought these based off reviews from others saying they are really hard to remove.  My 2 year old daughter has lost over 6-7 pairs of earrings in just the last 6 months so I'm sooooo over hunting for new earrings for her.  I was worried the size/ weight of these would be too large for a petite 2 year old but these look really cute and fit well.  My lo also has sensitive ears and is allergic to cheap earrings (she reacts to earrings that are gold/silver plated due to nickel often contained in the main portion of the earrings).  The hinge style closure is easy to see to put in her ear and they do seem to have a nice little ""snap"" when you close them-HOWEVER only a week or so after I first put these in her ears she has figured out how to unsnap them so they technically could fall out.  I just keep a close eye on her and discourage her from playing/pulling on her earrings and so far we haven't lost any.  Definitely on the plus side, I purchased the 3 pack so if she does lose one I have spares and the earrings are inexpensive enough I wouldn't worry about her losing one (like I would if she had more expensive earrings).  So if you're looking for earrings for your little one- buy these!  They're worth it! Perfect huggie hoops for 24 hour wear earrings that feel so light it's like you're not wearing anything in your lobes at all. I purchased the black pair. I always wanted black hoop earrings, & for my first pair these don't disappoint! They look expensive, the 6 gems have a nice shine to them. These are awesome!  They are small, which makes them PERFECT for my 3 year old daughter, who wanted to have hoops like myself and her big sister.  She's sensitive to metals, so it limits my choices a lot, as I do not want to spend a fortune on gold earrings for her that I was afraid she might lose.  She has had one other set of hoops and they did not latch securely enough, so she lost one the first day she wore them. Very cute. Wasn’t sure what to expect especially for the price. They are well made and I have been wearing them non stop and they haven’t tarnished nor have the caused an allergic reaction. My husband wears the black so they a definitely unisex. The also look just like my real gold so that no one can tell the difference.",1,1

"The best is very nice. The material is as described. The tie is not at all as pictured. (The only reason I bought this combo was for the matching tie) pleased with the quality just not as expected so slightly disappointed. Good vest too big for me The size is just right, wearing very comfortable, excellent workmanship, wireless head, no thread, the hem is no error is aligned, fabric bright color, no spinning, no damage, the design is also very good, in line with modern aesthetic, both Trendy yet dignified, cost-effective. Ordered a size larger than what I typically wear. The label says XL and has a 2 written in front of the XL. It's definitely too small. Great pattern design. I went a size larger than my normal size (I got an XXL) and I had to squeeze into this in the chest/shoulders and in the waist. I am 5'8"" and 200 lbs. I measured myself and there should have been about 2 inches of give in the shoulders and 3 in the waist based on the size chart. liked the vest but was not happy not getting the tie they show we ordered  three of the pink came with black ties don't like them at all ordered the white vest also came with black tie not what we wanted at all..

"I expected a cheap made shirt but I am totally satisfied with the purchase!  I'm medium built, 5'4"", 142 lbs, and the medium size fits comfortably for me.  The price is very reasonable and I would but again from the seller.  We just recently went to a Def Leppard concert, checked out the shirts and souvenirs, their prices are just as expected, OUTRAGEOUS!  I would have bought 2-3 shirts for the price I paid with you guys!  I will definitely buy again from y'all!  Thank you. Thanks for the great service and perfect fit. Went to a concert and wore my new shirt. Great times all around! Shirt fit well in the arms but was baggy in the body (not fitted).  Would be an excellent shirt if it was printed on a better slim/fitted t-shirt... Love this shirt, it looks great and I have had several compliment on it.  I have washed it a few times and the colors are still amazing! Fits great. It's tight but that is exactly the fit I wanted. It arrived in like 2 days. I am very happy with this purchase. Going to see them in June this will come in handy. 2017 Amazing shirt, been needing a Def Leopard shirt for a while, and this is perfect! Arrived as expected and a great shirt",1,1
"It's a sturdy, well-made box. The only true negative was the adhesive tabs used to keep the product info sheet on the front of the box. Most of them came off cleanly, but one refused to be removed without the use of GooGone and some fingernail scratching. Not a huge deal by any means, but something you should know if you're nit-picky like me and hate debris stuck to stuff... even if you're the only person on the entire planet who will probably see it. ;-) I have been looking for bins that would fit my closet maid door/wall organizer for months, maybe a year. So I was very happy to stumble upon these, made by another company in a local store. After bringing home the first set, I was so pleased I have ordered more from this manufacturer. These are identical in quality to the more expensive bins sold by Interdesign. love being able to see what's in the box. well made.. Great product! Sizing is great for what my needs were (see the description). Material is good quality - really worth the price. It's not as big as I had needed, but it is nicely made. Wonderful ... Exactly as described.. Nice box with hinged lid. Love this craft box. I purchased the larger craft box which I use to store my Dymo label maker along with the tape, and extra batteries. The lid doesn't stay closed since it doesn't have a latch, but for my needs, it works great. The craft box is made of sturdy acrylic and keeps my label maker safe and supplies organized. I would love to purchase more to store other supplies. I would highly recommend this craft box!",1,1
"I've had my GS3 Frontier watch for 3 days, so I am ready to update some of my initial observations.  Unlike a review that I read recently, I wasn't expecting the unboxing to be an experience unto itself; needless to say, the Frontier isn't a Rolex.  These were the positives that I found: Not many people seem to wear watches these days - and it's no wonder since for many it's just as easy to glance at your cell phone as it is to peek at your watch. This is where the Gear S3 excels - it gives you a good reason to wear it on your wrist. This smart watch is feature packed and delivers lots of goodies.  You get expected features like a large selection of watch faces, ability for receiving text messages & notifications, ability to answer/place calls, fitness tracker functions (pulse monitoring & step counting). There are some nice surprises also: It is water resistant, has an excellent battery life, and the Samsung pay feature lets you store your favorite credit/debit card information and pay by holding your watch up to almost any credit card reader - this always causing amazement in the checkout line. It even has its own built-in GPS. This watch uses Samsung's unique smartwatch OS called Tizen instead of Android Wear.  For me, performance has been rock steady and I've only needed to reset it a couple of times during the entire time I've used it.  I have the Bluetooth model that makes calls through the paired smart phone, in my case the Galaxy 7 edge.  The quality of the speaker phone is surprisingly good. I seldom do this but after Sunday I had to post. I received my S3 on 9/27/2017 and fell in love with it. The available apps and ease of use make this the best exercise, sleep tracking, watch, and phone extension. On Sunday I was working in my shop and I always put my phone on the counter by the door so I don't forget it when I lock-up. I needed  something from the loft and just as I stepped one foot off the ladder it slipped. I has a choice of falling onto my table saw (terrible idea) or dive onto the loft, I took the dive coming down awkward on my left arm braking it. Here",1,1

"Out of the fires of Orodruin, and forgotten for many centuries, the One Ring has passed unto me. I have had the pleasure of purchasing this artifact from a merchant for far below it's worth, in exchange I agreed to let my opinions of this Ring be known to the world*. I believe it may be safe to say this merchant knew not of the treasure they traded away. When I first received this ring, it looked fantastic and the gold colour was just perfect. After wearing it for 2 months (give or take), the gold started to fade revealing what was at the time pure tungsten. I'm not sure if they changed the metal or just changed the name. I still have the ring, it is not half silver half gold on the outer side of the ring, the inside of the ring is still gold. I bought a different ring to replace it, and will probably just wear this one on a chain or something. Hope this helps in your purchase. I really wanted to get this ring because I am a huge LOTR fan! I was so excited when it arrived in the mail. Of course I just had to give it to my husband to wear because they didn't have any sizes available that would fit me. I was surprised at the high quality of this ring.  It's fairly weighty and feels nice on my finger.  The size (11.5 for me) is perfectly stated in the chart, although I suspect the ring resized itself to fit me.  After reading about carbide tungsten and some of the other reviews, I was worried that the ring might shatter if I were to drop it.  Of course, within a week of receiving the ring, I accidentally dropped it on my tile floor.  It pinged and bounced about a few times as if looking for a new owner to enchant.  I was able to snatch up my precious quickly, intact, and it didn't have a scratch on it.  The elvish etching is crisp and nicely spaced.  My only complaint is that the elvish is a little hard to see in some lighting situations.  Anyway, I highly recommend this ring.",1,1

"My daughter just turned 2 and she's about 30 lbs and this fit her great.  I thought she would hate it but she didn't fuss at all when I put it on her and wore it a whole weekend at a lake on a the boat. It kept her face up no matter what and I felt she was extremely safe. The only thing is the strap that goes between her legs rubbed a little red spot on the side of her leg next to the bathing suit but the toddler size life jackets need that strap between the legs so they can't slip out so I don't see much of a way around that. It probably wouldn't do that on a boy with longer swim shorts. The fish design is very cute and great for a boy or girl. Also the handle at the top of the neck piece does come in handy besides being able to pull them out of the water in an emergency . She tripped on the dock and almost busted her face but daddy's quick reflexes grabbed that handle and saved the fall! The piece behind her head also served as a great pillow, she got very comfy and napped on the boat! Before you buy read up on the different types of life jackets. This one according to the insert ratings guide states it will not keep ALL faces out of the water. Investigations into ALL life jackets are so important before using. I have a chunky toddler and this PFD fit much better than the several other brands I tried. Finding a PFD with head support that fit a little bit bigger kid was hard, but this fit. My son is 20 months and weighs 29 pounds. He will be able to wear this at least through next spring, possibly longer. Haven't tried it in the water yet, but it fit my 18 month old, who is 33 inches tall and 27 lbs. I think she has some room to grow into it too. I am almost 100% happy with this. I picked the type with extra head support because obviously this vest is for a small child (2year old).  I love that it flips him up and over.  This will keep your child's head out of the water.  However, he can swim some.  This is very prohibitive from him swimming.  It keeps him so far tilted back, he is like a turtle on his back.  It deserves a 5 star because this vest obviously does its job in water and it is brightly colored and easy to spot.  I'm a mother of multiples and so I have all my smaller children wear life vests around water because I can become distracted by constant demands of toddlers.  If you are buying it for that reason, be aware. With this we do not have to worry if our toddler falls in the pool if the kids are outside because it just flips him right over on his back! Baby is 22.5lbs - tall with a thick rib cage - this fits perfect as expected. She hates it, as expected. VERY happy with purchase, very confident will keep her safe on boat/lake, however, I hope we're never forced to find out. Design is cute. Fit suggnly around my 14 month old.  Which is what you want.  There is room to expand and expect to use this for a couple more summers.  Safety is important and this vest is a good investment.  Would recommend for any outing.  It is a certified life vest as well, which is a bonus.  Colors stand out in the lake and the top handle is well stitched.",1,1
"All I can say is in not impressed 😂 I got a bootleg of the hat shown it was just horrible 😂 The frog isn't even same color then it's not even the same shape and also the hat itself is trash I thought I was getting what was in the picture lmao Would love it if the product ever arrived What the heck is this? Not the Kermit I saw in the product picture. I loved the way this hat looked but I have waited 4 months for it to come but it has not..... so if you decide to buy this I think you should try and find a better one Here's what the patch looks like versus what it is described and shown to look like....bootleg if you ask me. The hat also fits a little big and just looks plain goofy. Avoid buying this frog doesnt look like it does in the picture, but still funny. this hat is everything I hoped it would be. It's an amazing price, it arrived faster than I expected, and the embroidery is perfect! now I can say ""but that's none of my business"" without uttering a word. haha I get a lot of comments about this hat.  Most folk think it's Kermit drinking beer.  The poor ignorant fools.",1,1
"Item was a bit bigger but nothing that couldn't be worked with.  However, the baby will never be able to wear it because the button snaps to access diapers tore through the fabric, or popped completely off :(  Disappointed in product. The jumper is very cute. So cute, and perfect fit. Very thin. Not was I was expecting. The picture makes the outfit look better than it is. Ordered the 3 month size, got what must be premie. Also very low quality. Would not recommend. You small, buttons broke after first diaper change Love it I'm very  satisfied",1,1
"Very pleased with this purchase.  The quality and stitching is very good, and for the price, it is excellent value.  The suits look more expensive than they are.  I originally ordered the size my husband usually wears with 'Regular' suit cuts, so the 'Slim' was too snug (order a size up). We exchanged them for the next size and they fit perfect.  The only alteration needed is the pants length, but that is expected with any new suit.  Even the tailor mentioned that the quality of the suits is good.  We ordered 3 P&L suits and 1 DKNY, we only kept the P&L suits and returned the DKNY as it looked cheaper and not as good as the P&L and it was triple the price. For reference, my husband is 6'2 - 185 lbs and the 40R/W34"" fits like a glove. The one I ordered earlier like the photo posted here is great. Very nice piece of art! But the second one came in with a wrong model.  Also, remember this is a slim fit. So if you are used to only regular fit, size will not be forgiving in your armpit and in your thighs. Model numbers need to be updated and/or the photo must be updated. From the photo, I ordered a single-pocket not a double-poket navy (model no. 15020). And the seller needs to update the title of this model. Otherwise, the suit # 15020 navy is highly recommended for any professionals, e.g. medical students and other health professionals or business folks. As a first suit or a quick emergency pickup, this suit is actually spectacular for the price. Most importantly the jacket and pant waist size will fit exactly as the size selected. The only drawback, i guess, is that the pant bottoms will arrive un-hemmed but most people should not mind as they might prefer to be able to alter the length to their exact specifications anyway. The material is quite nice, smooth, and very light. The label says ""made in Cambodia"" for what its worth, but the lining and stitching was surprisingly detailed. The outer pockets on the jackets are sown shut so you will have to cut them open or have your tailor do that. Inside of the jacket, there are three very well lined & stitched pockets on the left and one more to the right. As for whether it is sufficiently slim or not, i can tell you that the jacket definitely is slim & snug, however the pants are slightly wide and un-hemmed but again, its a quick fix with a visit to a tailor. For $80, you are definitely getting the most bang for your buck. Fits like a glove.  My arms are a little too short so it needs sleeve adjustment, about half inch, otherwise fits so nicely. The pocket flaps and lapels are thinner than traditional all in the new style of slim fitted suits. The pants is a slim fit so expect it to be a little on the tighter side. Material will stretch too. I'm very happy with this purchase. Really surprised at the fiy and quality.  I needed a new suit and so i ordered two online.  One from another company and the other from Amazon.  The  P&L suit rom Amazon fit perfectly right out of the box.  I took the suit in to get the pants hemmed and the seamstress was surprised how good everything fit.  I and 6'0 185lbs and ordered the 42L with 36 waist.  The jacket looks like it was tailored just for me and the pants fit perfect even though it says size 36 (fyi- my normal pant size is 32).  I am actually having  the $700 suit from the other company altered to fit like the P&L suit!  I will ordered more in the future from P&L Pretty nice suit, only one thing I would've done differently... Nice suit, definitely slim fit, if you're on the borderline, order up or drop 10-15 pounds :-). The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pockets. They're those kind that kinda jut out at the sides. I prefer completely flat front side pockets. Suit is shipped nicely in a box, hung on one of those big suit hangers that accommodate the pants and jacket nicely. Also, my local dry cleaners charged me 12 bucks to have the inseam altered, so factor that into the price as well, unless you do your own sewing. My son needed a suit in a hurry.  Nothing quite like planning.  Anyway, we saw this alternative and all I can say to sum it all up.  Thank you.  Fit great and looked great. He is 6ft 6 and slim.  To find something for him is always a challenge.  Pants come un hemmed so allocate some time to hemm them correctly.  Thanks again Very nice suit for the price. Just remember to order 1 or 2 sizes larger. I'm 6'3"" and 200 pounds. I generally wear a 44 Long. With the 44L I ordered I couldn't button the jacket or pants. A 46L probably would have done the trick.",1,1

"These glasses are spectacular! I have been buying Costco readers for years (3@ $18). I always thought that cheap glasses were meant to break. I always expected to get a few months and then discard because something happened; frame broke, nose pad came off, lens popped out, etc. I even ventured into buying a more expensive pair and got the same wear time. Very frustrating. I have been buying reading glasses from Amazon for ten years. I can't do anything without them. They are scattered around my house and vehicles. Because I buy so many I have treied countless brands. I always bought the cheapies. I decided to take a chance on something more expensive. I am glad I did. These are the best and highest quality glasses I have ever had. I just gathered up all my cheapies and tossed them in the trash. I ordered a bunch more of these. They are my go to glasses from now on. I ordered a set of the half rimmed rectangular gunmetal reading glasses for my husband. I had read somewhere to purchase reading glasses at the dollar store which is what he wanted anyway- he never cleans them and doesn't care what they look like- The glasses themselves are good.  They're clear and fit well.  They're 3.25 strength -- my local stores only carry up to 3.00, so it was good to find these online. Just as described, very good quality, clear lenses.  They look good and I now I can read clearly.  Hint:  try to make sure you get the correct strength.  Previous to buying these, I went to a local store to get a pair of reading glasses.  Not really knowing what strength I needed I got a pair that was too strong (2.0, I figured it probably wouldn't hurt).  During my annual eye exam, my doctor told me I really should be using 1.5, which is what I ordered from Amazon.  Big difference, I would have thought the stronger ones would have been better, but it didn't turn out that way.  A slightly less powerful lens makes reading much, much easier.  For less than I paid for one set at the local store, I got three pairs of really good glasses, couldn't be happier. Ok - so to be honest ... I'm one of those idiots that has spent the better part of his life in front of a computer and burned his eyeballs to a fraction of what they used to be. I've complicated that by trying to mitigate it by using reading glasses. Just spent the last 3 years in China... and reading glasses there are sooooo cheap. So I've been ordering cheap bundles of them from AMZ since I've been back ... but this is the first order from these guys. I just got them 40 min or so ago. Man.. it was amazing (and no, they're not paying me a dime) --- crystal clear, thick lens, great frames..... beats the hell outta' Shanghai street vendor fare. Highly recommend. I purchased the 3.25 glasses and they were a perfect match for the expensive drug store brand I bought.  With these being half frame, it’s very easy to look over them when I’m reading or on my I-Pad and watch TV.  I actually wear these a lot as the low frame allows me to walk and drive with out removing  them. The frame is very sturdy like a much expensive pair would be. The lense itself seems to be a good quality and I haven’t experienced any scratches from cleaning or storing them and I’ve had them well over a week. Overall, an excellent value for quality reading glasses. I got these for the budget price. I sometimes loose them. They get scratched because I leave them lying around. I try to keep them wherever I might need them, so this was a great choice. I got a set of the ""classic"" rimmed as well. This is the second time I have purchased them. One pair from my original order did drop to the floor in Walmart and snapped in two at the nose. I am pleased, because of the price. I also like the spring hinge because I hook them in the collar of my shirt when I don't have a shirt pocket.",1,1
"I sent these to my  son who is renting a house with 2 friends while he is several hours away at college.  The price was lbrower than it actually is now (I just noticed) and at the time I was worried thinking for just an inexpensive price, how good would they be?  Well my son received a few days ago and he said that they were a great set.  My is actually a pretty good cook and does a lot of elaborate meals when he has time.  So I believed him when he talked about how awesome the were.  He has used both the pans and they are non-stick and he said really do a nice job of cooking the chicken he make  He has also used 2 of the pots and said they too were quality and really nice and he feels that this will be a set that will take him through his 4 more years of college living.  He also told me that the bonus spatula and spoons and cooking utensils were something that they really needed.  They are really nice quality as well and won't scratch the pots and pans when using them which is super important. The color I sent was the gray and he and his roommates really like the modern look of them.  I am very happy with this purchase, especially since we bought them when they were a lower price.  Even though he says they were definitely worth much more than we paid, I think I will wait to see if they have another special and order myself a set. I needed a new skillet and decided on the one in this pack (and gave the rest the pots and utensils to a friend for Christmas). In my old 10.5 inch skillet the flat surface was nearly 8.5 inches, so I expected to lose only a little surface by going to a skillet only 0.5 inches smaller. Wrong. The flat surface in this pan measures 7 1/16 inches due to the curved sides. I can't even put two slices of bread side-by-side in it to make 2 grilled-cheese sandwiches at once, and where in the old one I could get 4 hamburger patties in, I can get 2-3 in if I make them the size of slider burgers, or one flat and another partly up the side. Very disappointing. I had never used wearever prior to this purchase but I'm very pleased with the quality of my new set of pans. I was a bit disappointed that the skillet wasn't larger, as this is the piece I will use most,  but I can't complain because I did not look and see what size it was before I purchased it. As for using these pots and pans they have preformed better than expected especially  for the price I paid for them. They have a very good overall feel to them and cook beautifully. The nonstick surface is great and they clean up easily. Remember to never use metal on your nonstick pans! The pots and pans are pretty nice. What we were looking for in terms of non stick. Seem to be good construction, handles are great too. The crappy part about these are the lids. They sat very poorly on the pots (think circles vs. ovals), and not sure if they were meant for the pans also, like most other sets out there, but they do not work on the pans at all. The pans have a rounded over edge that the lids cannot sit in, rather they kind of try to sit on (like trying to rest something on top of a ball). They are ok i guess. Don't get why these pots are warping / lifting in the center which makes  that 1 tbs of oil run to the edges make it impossible to saute garlic. which is quite annoying. But i have tired a few pots lately and I.m yet to find one that doesn't do this. Was never a problem before. Probably something manufacturers are doing to cut comers is resulting in these poor quality pots. Got to admit I had very high hopes for this set. I read the reviews on amazon and I was excited. Ive had these for 3 months now and they are done for. I wash them with the soft side of the sponge and I only use these pans with the utensils it brought. Im a single person and I cook 2 a week. Not a good purchase. Complete set, well packaged and they look good quality.  I'm sure they will last us a few years at least (then again, we don't cook everyday so they may not be exposed to heavy duty use). But if you are looking for a ""starter"" set, I'm sure this would be perfect! I was so disappointed in these pans.  About after the third use, they warped.  Don't waste our money.",1,1

"This is a cool adaptation of these organizer grids. I had never seen one before for the sun visor. It has fit well in my Jeep and not slid at all. Currently, it is holding a few cords, my bluetooth earpiece, and a spare set of sunglasses. The grid has not shifted at all with driving so far. This is a really cool idea and I think it works well to de-clutter your car. Please see the video if you want to see a demo. Nice idea with the random assortment of bands. I like that i can just squeeze something in wherever it fits because there will probably be an open stretchy band. It is super easy to put on my sunvisor and i think it will be great when i have the door off my jeep. I am really glad I found this product as I have so many loose cords, my ipod nano, ipod and so much more in my truck and this helped me to organize them all. I have a great deal of things on this and the bands are not only holding up well after three months, the visor is holding everything I put on it and that is a lot. More than pleased, will be buying more for my kids cars too! Decent place to keep various little things. I wish it was a tad smaller. Also having it in different colors would have been good. Since installing it, I only used it to keep my sunglasses in place a few times. The bands don't seem to have a lot of retention.  I will update if they hold up well. Love this! Great space saver Perfect for visor and catching small items! Didn't fit my car it ran big but very good quality. I gifted it and they loved it.",1,1

"This was amazing. Theres a guy I work with who talks way too much about chicken. This was a gift to him and he didn't see it coming. Oh my goodness. The quality is what you'd expect for $4. It's more just for fun. This hat is adorable and so much fun . I bought this hat for my 7 year old daughter to wear for crazy hat day at school..She and everyone else had so much fun with it..She is small for her age so I was afraid it would not fit ..but it ..it was a little big on her but it did not fall off... I am average sized woman and it fit me perfect and had enough stretch for my husband to wear as well. Very good product definitely have gotten my money out of it . Great buy!! This chicken hat is the most authentic chicken hat I have ever owned. It meets all my needs and is great for any occasion. I used to be the boring guy at work who just faded into the background but now, im the focus in the office and all the ladies look at me with that ""special look""! The felt material keeps me warm in the winter and acts as a sweatband in the summer! By far the greatest multipurpose item sold on this website!!!!! I love it so much that I put in an order for 10 more so I can wear one every day! I highly recommend this item!!!!! Fit my 5 year old's little 50th percentile head perfect. Made of thin felt and one of the legs fell off after just a few hours of use but for the price, it was worth a few hours of laugh. cheap, but fun Kinda small, considering I have an average sized adult head. My sister enjoyed using this Great item, quick shipping,,,, great company to buy from ... thanks.",1,1

I saw Buffalo Soldier in an article in Clean Living Magazine and thought I would give it a try, even though it was not organic.  Glad I did...it was the best coffee I have ever had. Bob Marley has been a part of my coffee routine for years. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting something bold and smooth. I have since gone to a whole bean style, I love the smell and flavor of freshly ground beans. I'm not quite a coffee snob but I'm a coffee purist, only black coffee for me and this meets my needs. Fair Trade! This is our favorite coffee!  We switched to fair trade, organic only about 6 months ago and have tried a variety of options including Kicking Horse, Jo, Audubon Society, and more, but after one bag of Marley, we knew we were hooked.  I'm really sensitive to acidity, and can say that this coffee is super smooth with no bitterness or acidic undertones found in many other brands.  Drinking this has ruined every other coffee for me - everything is either too weak, too acidic, or just gross compared to Marley Coffee! Yummy, yummy coffee! I drink it black, because it needs no help to be delicious. It's not quite to the smoothness of other Ethiopian yergacheffe I've had, but it is very good. Makes a delicious everyday coffee that doesn't taste like those yucky big name American coffees This One love ethiopian coffee is now probably my number one go to coffee. I have a ninja coffee bar and this coffee allows for bolder brews and over ice brews and forte brews without being bitter. It always has a great coffee taste. I will definately be reordering this for a long time. I am so glad i tried it. Even just the smell of it brings a smile to my face. Wonderful coffee!!!!!  I am one of those people that like my coffee like mud!  The stronger the better, but without the bitter flavor!!!!  To find that is hard, but this is one of the better coffees Ive tried!  Honestly I probally wouldn't have bought it myself but a friend had it and served it with dessert one night!  After that I had to buy it, I brew it in a French Everyone give it a try!!!! It's good but I don't taste the caramel in it which is why I ordered it.  I've been using it with my French pRess.  I'm going to try it in the old fashioned coffee maker.  Good but not as good as I expected I love the taste of this coffee but it's not quite a fine enough grind for espresso.",1,1

"Great stickers durable, sticks very good at the back glass of my car, doesn’t damage with the rain or when I wash my car great for my car because the windows are dark, and other stickers were only to use inside, so outside they look invisible. I’m happy with these and comes couple of them. Love these! Super cute and let’s people know to not be a jerk because my little babe is with me. Still trying to convince my husband to put his on his truck though! 😂 Rather solid product: no issues sticking it to the car, still there after regular car washes, snow, salt and my curiosity. Picture was made 2 months after the purchase. Seem to hold up fine so far. We’ll see after winter how the stickers held up. Good but kind of expensive for the quality. Also runs small Bought one of these for myself and some for my friends, they are awesome! Not very suction ,  it was fall down so many times Bought it as a joke for a friend.....it went over great!",1,1

"was a gift, she loves it I bought them for a friend and she loves them. She said they are the right weight and cleans up good. I ordered this regal cookware and received in a timely manner. The cookware seemed not to match product description of Tri/Ply 18/8 Stainless Steel. The pots had no markings on the bottom which seemed odd as they were supposed to be of high quality Tri/Ply 18/8 Stainless Steel. Regal's name was not on the pots but just a tag in the box. I called Regal to verify if this was their product, and I got an intial I don't think so response. After a long delay, customer service said they were selling some cookware at the retail level but were unsure about the lack of markings. The pots were very light and did not seem to be tri/ply 18/8 ss (I could be wrong). I felt the product wwas inferior and contacted Amazon about a return. Amazon took the cookware set back with no problem. Lifetime that is made by Regal/West Bend has 7 ply. This product is 3 ply. You get what you pay for I guess.",-1,-1

"Got spoiled on these when in the hospital, so was happy to find them on amazon....They work well. Great product for cleansing sensitive area. It’s soft and non irritating. I use these to wash my mother up. I learned of them from the hospital she was in. They use them, so I ordered my own. wish they came more to a pack I first used this product in the hospital & liked it so much that i ordered a box of them from Amazon when I got home. This product is soo gentle on the skin & I have very sensitive skin. I will continue to use this product as long as it is available. These are the best for cleanup during colonoscopy prep. They are soft and have soothing thick liquid in them. Do not make you irritated and raw like baby wipes, and did not violate the doctor's prohibition of creams or ointments. Have ordered this a number of times and it works quite well. Awesome product!",1,1
"Hello, parcel arrived quickly. commodity satisfied packaged well, the belt looks and sits perfectly on me very well. I recommend this seller and a special thanks to him for a little present. good shopping. This is my second belt. I have to say I like the style and functionality of this belt. I love the cowhether cow leather belt  because I like a nice tight belt. I love the look of this belt as it looks and feels like it is worth lot more than the retail price. The belt buckle is solid and not flimsy. On my first belt I was unsure how to open it initially and if you buy this you need to practice getting the belt off. There is a latch that you need to know to pull up. If the belt is tight you need to know to pull it tighter as you pull the latch up. Once you get it, you got it. I think this belt looks great on a pair of jeans or at work with a suit and tie. It is very easy to cut to size as well. The belt end where the buckle is comes undone so you can just cut the belt with a good pair of kitchen scissors. This is a nice belt. I received this belt for a reduced cost to provide my honest review which I have provided. Is good belt. Perfectly packed, fully wrapped on the plate was a dense plastic case. very fast delivery Speed of delivery is excellent. beautiful packaging. quality of goods good insult goods excellent. I recommend not regret it! Delivered in time during time protection and after 4 weeks from order. quality as expected. Good transaction and Seller",1,1

"Size seems to run true on this set. I have used other sets from this same vendor and they ran small, but order your regular US size and you should be fine. I wouldn't buy it again. real nice and classie Great product for what I was using for. Nice 😎 The quality was very nice. The color was more orange then gold and I hated it. Attempting to return it to TieDrake and thus far have been unsuccessful. Will update once resolved. Nice I have no idea what there standards for sizing are, but this is just foolish.",1,1
"I never tried any of these on. What came isn't completely what is shown and described on the sales page.  I ordered the pink and white ones in size 5. They smelled very toxic and at least one of them had a grey white stripe design. And I believe atleast 1 other panty wasn't white or pink. I already returned the pack of them.  One of these panties had a significant amount of polyester in them making that one even more toxic. At my local grocery I purchased a set of higher quality, Premium, mostly cotton  (no polyester), bikini, Hanes panties which I really like in a set of 4/5 panties.  I wanted more of those which are far less toxic among other things. . My grocery and Targets have been out of the panties I want more of.  But, these are not it. And are way to toxic for me. But, I have a Sensory Processing Disorder and ASD so, I notice smells and are affected buy them more then some people. I wear white capri's, jeans, and slacks in the summer.  Love 'em. First let me say the panties are wonderful. They fit great and they don't ride up on me.  I ordered what said pink and white in the drop down list, so of course I was expecting pink panties, white panties and/or some combination of pink and white, and what I received was pink, white, gray, one pair that is a combination of pink white and grey and black. It actually would have altered my decision to purchase this set if I had known that the colors gray and black were in it as well. They have rough kind of edges and hurt by the end of the day. The ""comfort"" bands are not at all comfortable. Honestly, I'm going commando a few days to let everything heal. Cheap cotton for sure, it feels scratchy and stiff...especially after washing. Not much shape, and completely shrink after 1 wash/dry cycle. I ordered a size larger than I am assuming these would shrink, they are so small after 1 washing that they aren't wearable anymore. It fits well as in not having any soggy parts. But it feels bigger than I expected on the butt and the top band sets in a way that it marks any belly if you are wearing some thin fabric dress or skirt. I always wore a size 5, but I thought I'd order a size 6 for some wiggle room. They were a bit big when they arrived, so I washed them in hot water to shrink them. That did the trick, and now they fit perfectly. Glad they are 100% cotton! They fit as expected for a size 6, but you should know they will shrink a bit if washed in hot water. This would have been great but where the seam meets by your hip, it rubbed so bad I couldnt wait to take them off. The whole pack was this way. Maybe I just got a bad batch.",1,1

"Quality material and looks awesome. Just need to find another reason to wear it. Very good looking. Perfect for prom or wedding. Well made n looks like the picture Love the quaity, color and design, I get many compliments on it.  Priced very reasonable! perfect Slightly cheaper material than I was hoping for/expecting.  Wider at the waist than it should have been for the size I ordered, but overall not too bad for the price. Just right It works",1,1
"Purchased this monitor back some time ago as a backup for my existing Dell monitor which was becoming problematic. The existing monitor finally died, but it 2 to 3 months after the purchase. As you might expect, the order was outside the warranty and return period. It had never been out of the box until about a week ago.  I have not been able to get it to work with various new cables and have not been able to get the monitor to work on exiting computers with a Dell monitor that is working. Odd issue with my system. When the monitor is plugged in, my power button doesn't function. If I shut my computer down, I have to unplug the monitor to turn my system on. Also, when I turn the monitor off, my computer thinks it's been completely disconnected and gives me the ""hardware unplugged"" noise, sending my primary display over to my secondary screen. Still, beautiful picture when it's on. I bought two of them for a dual monitor setup and they work perfectly, the colors are good and the size is perfect for my setup. I would recommended the monitors due to their size and ease to use VESA mounting for. The stand doesn't hold the monitor well. It moves by itself because of its own weight and had to reassemble constantly since day number one... Until it fell on my desk today. The monitor fell on my desk, then on my sofa and spoiled my documents, my desk, my sofa and the right corner of the screen is cracked. I should of return this monitor since I got it a few months ago. Super bright monitor..I already bought 2 and would love to buy more when needed. The only problem with this monitor though is that it doesn't have a HDMI port which made it difficult for me to get the necessary cables to connect it to the dock. Great picture and good performance. I am using 2 of them and for the price is a good deal Low quality, low color clarity.  Not impressed but functional for an office computer.  Grainy. I suppose leaving a star off because it does not have an adjustable stand is a bit petty.  We use them for work things so high resolution and refresh rate are not all that important.  Great buy for the money.",1,1

"We are a big fan of the Tune Cat series of shoes, our boys have had quite a few pairs over the years. We were especially excited about this Navy Blue with White and Red color because that is the exact colors of our sons school uniforms. We are now 3 months into the school year and they are holding up very well. Plan on purchasing another paid in a size up for when he grows out of these. Also, If you have younger kids...the Tune Cats with Velcro Straps are highly recommended as well. Go Puma! my kids wear a dark blue/red uniform to school.  Sneakers are up to the parents/kids.  So most wear some complicated combination of colors (orange, red, green, neon, lights, pink, etc...)  You know kids, has to wow them w/ color.  But they end up looking good from the ankle up, and ridiculous when viewed from the bottom of the foot up.  Now, my kids think these are fast looking/cool shoes.  And they're simple enough to actually look nice with anything. Look great. Great quality. My son thinks they are not wide enough for his feet, but I am sure they are going to stretch a little :) Toe box area runs small (and my kid has narrow feet). Overall, they seem to run at least a size smaller. We love these style of shoes. It's the only one we get our child but in dissent model.  This, was big,  so we returned it My daughter loves her shoes. They are easy to run in and look :cute: with her outfits. SLAY A gift for my grandson. He likes them so much that he doesn't want to wear them outside because they will get dirty. better tooth being too small....looks good...thinking of getting another pair for myself",1,1
"Great set of pots, sturdy and high quality.  The handles are long, ergonomically shaped and very comfortable to hold and they look beautiful.  The nickel free was a major selling point for us, which you can't find elsewhere.  I had an issue with one of the pans when it arrived so was prepared to knock off a star or two, but customer service went above and beyond my expectations, they are seriously really nice people!  I have not lost confidence in my purchase.  Thanks Homi Chef! 1) the product is amazing ! I’ve used all my pots and pans without any issues. If you’re a stickler for water damage and keeping your steel super shiny, Homi Chef does a great job providing tips and advice to do just that. I personally don’t mind that stuff at all I just cared about finding high quality products that were safe from nickel and aluminum and all that extra stuff for a great price! The HOMI CHEF 14-Piece Mirror Polished Nickel Free Stainless Steel Cookware Set is worth every dime I paid.  Was teetering between the HOMI CHEF S/S 3.5 QT Stock Pot (from Homi Chef website, which is actually unavailable), HOMI CHEF 8 QT Stock Pot  and the HOMI CHEF 7-Piece Cookware Set.  So glad I bought the 14 set because it has everything I need and is the most bang for buck.  This set is meant for at most 3 adults.  Buy the 7 piece set if you are cooking for more people (but the 7 piece set doesn't have cooking utensils and costs more!). Pros: I love this set already! It's gorgeous and easy to clean. It shipped very timely and the quality is great! I cook very simply and I believe the warranty will last longer than 6 years. I hope to add the steamer and a larger stock pot too my collection in the near future.  I love this easy cleanup of the pans with some vinegar. I just feel better cooking out of nickel free stainless steel. I had no idea that this cookware could be so affordable.  I am delighted! I would definitely recommend it. I absolutely love this cookware set.  It not only met my expectations, but exceeded them.  I highly recommend the set.  Excellent quality, cooks very fast, and I love the steam escape on the lids so I now don't have to turn on my fan exhaust (a bit noisy). Bought this midrange set for my DIL.  She loves them. Healthier way to cook. A little more work to clean than the non-stick pans but use bar keepers and they come out beautiful.  Rather put a minute of effort than I ingest chemicals.",1,1

"I was a devoted Pantene user for years and then stopped 3 years ago because of advice from others and because I was looking for a more natural product. I should have started by saying that I have natural very curly cool hair. Anyway, I've tried Carol's daughter which I still use when I can find it, and then Wen. My hair broke off while using Wen. I got frustrated and went back to the product which gave me beautiful, shinny, bouncy curls, Pantene. It appears as if Pantene has tried to make a product with fewer harmful chemicals. I love it because the breakage immediately stopped after using this product. I use the conditioner as a co-wash everyday. To do that I've added about 50 drops or so of lavender oil. I then work it thorough my hair, leave in for 5 mins or so and then rinse in cool water. I use the shampoo+conditioner about twice a month for a fresh start. I also add lavender oil to the shampoo+conditioner. I love my hair again. I must also write that pantene has added a detangler or maybe it's the lavender oil because I can run my fingers or a wide tooth comb through my hair very easily with this product in, and my hair is very curly. I have used this product for one month and my hair has grown over an inch and it's thickening. Over all a great product and I will definably recommend it! Nice shampoo but not quite as good as the hype. I still get tangles and was really hoping this would eliminate them, it didn't but it helped. The more I use this shampoo, the more I like it. It definitely leaves my hair looking fuller and thicker than other shampoos that I have tried recently. Overall, this is one of the best shampoos I have used. I have very fine, very tangly blonde hair that I professionally color black. My hair notoriously does not hold permanent die. I've been dying my hair since 2009 using the same Paul Mitchell The Color products and low % developer, but in the past year my hair has been quite dry. Using this definitely makes my hair noticeably softer and less dry. I've tried many color fast/color protecting/moisturizing products both expensive and normally priced and this is one of the best. I will shortly be comparing it to Silk 18 conditioner and will report my findings. Pantene is a great product, but I have thin hair.. And as much as I love it and need the conditioning, unfortunately, the conditioner DOES weigh thin hair DOWN... SO I can wash my hair at night before bed and the next morning when I get up, I need to wash it again because it SO greasy and just gunked up from the thickness of the conditioner... I can't stand my hair to be so heavily weighed down from. Conditioner like I need to wash my hair out again because it feels greasy and dirty... So I may have to find a light weight conditioner. WORKS GREAT ON MY LONG, THICK AND DRY HAIR. MAKES MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINY! ALONG WITH SHAMPOO I USE CONDITIONER AND LEAVE IN CONDITIONER. THIS REGIMEN IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR ME. PRICE WAS GOOD AS AN ADD-ON. FAST DELIVERY. I RECOMMEND. I didn't purchase this for me, rather for my teenage daughter. Why? Because I got it on sale one time and after using it, she declared -- rather dramatically -- that it was the absolute best shampoo she'd ever used and that I just HAD to buy it for her from now on. Well -- how can you argue with a testimonial like that :-D Use twice per week, leaves hair silky My hairstylist gave me an organic shampoo, he said was very good-well no way Jose-there is nothing like Pro-Pantene for color treated hair. It gives my fine hair volume & conditioner built in works great on softness & detangling.  I recommend very highly.",1,1

"Beautiful shoe indeed! Just as vibrant as the picture itself....but better guys. I wear btw a 7 & 7.5. Before reading the reviews, mostly on beauty, I missed the part whereas the DO RUN SLIGHTLY LARGE. I'm returning this pair for a 1/2 size smaller. The area where your toes would be is widened. My feet are narrow also. I hope that this helps ladies. Love the color. I already had 3 pair. Shoes are excellent for jogging and workouts! Best shoes I’ve ever had for comfort. Feels like i’m on jogging on clouds. I am a fan of these shoes! I have so many different colors of the same shoe, but I love the fit! I always get compliments whenever I wear any of my Puma shoes! Arrived on time and the fit is fabulous and they make my feet look smaller.....I wear an 11 in women and you can't tell!!!! The color is awesome!!!! These shoes are soooooo nice! Had to return due to the fact that my daughter has wide feet....otherwise they would have been perfect!!! They are pretty. The width is perfect. The shoe is cut a tad short. I'm going to order a half size bigger. Comfortable and stylish! Got a lot of compliments! These shoes are too cute, I purchased the blue pair, they are very comfortable and stylish",1,1

Had to translate the instructions which are in Mandarin. Scales do not work at all. Tried different batteries. I will have to send this back. Disappointed and the second Lazada order which has been faulty. Weight measurement is incorrect. When I weight myself there is variation in weight measured whenever I weight. And difference is always more than 1 kg. Also it doesn't weight upto 2 kg while in product description its written it can weigh upto.2 kg. Good Product.  Service from Lazada is good.

"Theres an extra snap at the end that seems dumb and it really bothers me because it doesnt snap to anything, or help in any productive way. Also one of the snaps is backwards, ill attach a picture to show what i mean. Besides that, its ok, but nothing special. The material is cheap and it is not put together well and the stitching is coming undone in multiple places, again ill add pictures to illustrate this. Im kinda disappointed cuz i thought it was going to be a good gift, but i doubt ill give it to its intended recipient because im a little embarassed of the quality. Also my kit only has 27 items including the wrap, and this has an exacto knife in it, so not for a kid. This kit is great for my son to take to school or use at home. I think there are duplicate pencils, I only had a few minutes to go through it as we were leaving the next morning and I had to wrap it quickly. I recommend taking out the pencil sharpener if this is going to school. Its a literal utility knife (for those who don't know, its a razor on one side, I'm sure the school would frown on that). As far as I know, the pencils work great. The erasers are cool. I don't know what the pencil lengthening tool is supposed to do. None of the pencils that I could find, in the kit or around my house, fit into the hole. I even took a pair of pliers to it and then the ring becomes useless and the pencils still don't fit. Maybe someone could describe it to me. The paper ""erasers"" don't erase. I tested them on some scrap paper. So all three charcoal pencils look the same size and hardness. There are 4 4b, 2 2b, 2 2b, and the rest seem one of a kind. I don't know about the strap. When you roll the kit up there are a few inches of extra strap. I recieved this and I opened it and it included the following: 1 pc 8B, 1 pc 7B, 1pc 6B, 1 pc 5B, 4 pcs 4B, 2 pcs 3B, 4 pcs 2B, 1 pc B, 1 pc HB, 2 pcs 2H, 3 different charcoal pencils which are labeled in chinese, a soft eraser, a kneadable eraser and NO paper blending pencils (or ""paper erasable pencils"" as the description says) Nice set, I put my fine liner ink pens in also. For those of you trying to figure out how to roll it up. Just start with the end that doesn’t have the strap, roll and snap. That extra snap is so you can wear it like an apron around your stomach Perfect ! just what I wanted and as shown! This set of pencils and supplies was very nice.  It was put together in a faux leather case that was also very nice.  Easy to organize your pencils and art supplies and rolled up into a compact case.  I definitely would buy more supplies from the company. Okay so I love the kit but I don't quite know how it is supposed to be rolled up or folded, the strap that is on it is weird. Or I'm not used to it. Either way good product weird design with no instructions unless I'm missing something. Nice stocking stuffer for my creative son in law.",1,1
"So it can be a tad confusing choosing between the Arctis 3, 5 and 7. I was under the impression that the more expensive model, the Arctis 7 would have a better sound stage, but I was wrong. All the headphones have the same sound card, but each headset have extra bells and whistles that are intended to work for PC,  NOT the Xbox One. I don't own a PS4 so I cannot comment on if these extra features will work/won't work. Arctis 7 Review Admittedly my only basis for comparison is a pair of Turtle Beach headphones I bought for over $100, which didn't particularly wow me, and they weren't very comfortable and were clunky. I also dont often play with headphones as I've got a pretty decent home stereo set up that I enjoy.",-1,-1
"I purchased this box to add to our snack assortment for a long road trip. I was excited to check this out, but was disappointed to receive it. I bought these on an impulse, and what I hate about this most, it is that it reminds me that I am stupid, and easily tricked out of money. And also that I should probably dial back my bourbon intake. I ordered a box of 48 candy items and when I opened it I discovered that their version of a candy item is an individual piece of jolly rancher candy, and there were a lot of them. These GIFT BOXES ARE VERY MISLEADING and they should be required to tell customers exactly what's in the box and the exact weight of each package! I have no clue why I bought this. Maybe I was just hungry and wanted all the snacks. Most of the pieces we received were single serving pieces of candy (think- 3 jolly ranchers, airhead, 1 piece of bubblegum, etc.) I've been ordering from Amazon for years now and mostly very happy with my purchase.  But this was the worst purchase ever for me the perceived value just did not meet expectation i will never order this again. Great idea! poor packaging - lots of crumbs... Got exactly what was described. Nothing was out of date. Nothing was crushed. None of it is stale. The box it comes in is very small, but it did contain everything listed. Is it a good value? Not at all. But for a gift box or a variety package to try some new products, it's great. The picture shows the big packs, but when I got them, 14 of the 40 were individual bite size candies.  Not a good value.  Why not just say 26 and bonus individual candy?  It did not appear to be ""clean"" because that kind with wax paper wrapping usually comes with outer packaging.  Sending it back.",1,1

"They have a nice rigid frame. They don’t feel flimsy at all. I liked them so much, I ordered five more in another color!  I keep them everywhere! As I misplace, scratch or break my readers regularly, I don't invest much in them but still want something fun to wear. I ordered the multi-color pack on a lightning deal and I was more than pleased when I received the readers. They seem well-made, and come sealed in individual plastic bags to avoid scratching. Eyeglass cases are included, also. These are great, well-made, cute readers!  They got here fast and there is a color to go with any outfit.  They are good quality with no distortion and are very comfortable.  I have a larger face so I was a little worried they might be snug but they are very comfortable.  The measurements on the listing are accurate.  Each pair comes with it's own soft case.  They included a good size cleaning cloth as well.  I highly recommend giving these a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.  I'm a very happy camper! These are not very good glasses.  The strength is really a number less than on the glasses as far as I can tell. For the price though they will do. These glasses are very good quality. While there are a lot of fairly inexpensive reading glasses available, not all are quality. I just received these glasses today and I am impressed by the quality of the frame and glass. I am impressed. I will buy these in the future after I have lost all my pairs of glasses here and there. Wow!  I expected these to be thin and pretty much disposable.  I go through so many reading glasses.  I lose them, cats chew on them. Great quality and great style.  The arms even have a spring in them so they are comfortable with less of a chance to break.  They also came individually bagged, with cases and a cleaning cloth.  Will definitely order again when I manage to lose these.  Ha! No more standing in the drug store, searching through a messy display rack looking for reading glasses in the right magnification.  Just click on the right magnification and get what you want.  In cool colors.  And you get a whole set for a reasonable price.  So, you could change them out to match your outfits.  These are nice quality and come packaged nicely.  The frustration of having your reading glasses break and having to hunt two stores for new ones is over.",1,1

"Got this for my wife so that she won’t misplace the case while at work. She loves the color, but the case is just way too thick. It’s 3 times thicker than the average silicone phone cases. Other than that, it protects the case, the airpod neck loop holds well, and the carrabeaner allows her to attach it to her purse. Good quality, easy to use, and soft to touch. Good price as well- especially considering the fact the these come with a carbiner clip and attaching wire. Airpod cases tend to get scratched easily; I'm glad this cover will keep it safe and scratch-free. This is the best. As a matter of fact I dropped my AirPods and this case protected them. But you have to take the AirPods case out of this rubber case before charging or you can ruin your AirPod houseing case o This is an awesome little case! Great for not only protecting the charging case from scratches, I love the clip so it doesn't get lost in my purse. cover is awesome works as expected, when you have the skin in the charging case and you pop open the top , the skin might cause it not to open all the way as it should but after a couple of uses that loosens up , also the strap is awesome however mine snapped unfortunately not sure as to why , it did have a thin slice on it but I didn’t think much of it , maybe that was the cause . Very protective for the air pods case ! Recommend it 100%! Love them. The sound is excellent! great item ... fits perfectly on your airpod case and the color makes it easy to find in your bag",1,1

"I saw no reviews for this, but I loved the pattern and color, so I ordered it for my boyfriend for our Christmas party at work. It fit perfectly and was shipped nicely. I had to iron it, of course, because it had been folded, but that was to be expected. I do have to say - but I won't take away stars for this - the description says ""free plastic bag"". I thought it would be like a dry cleaning bag for storing on a hanger; not necessarily high quality, just a simple plastic bag. The bag is only the regular packaging for a vest and not suitable for storing the vest. But overall, a very nice vest and exactly what we were hoping for. After reading the reviews on sizing, I decided to order larger up. I normally wear a large and ordered a XL. Too big, I should have ordered a L or maybe a medium. I'm 5'11 190 build and it fit well in the shoulders but very large around the chest and belly area. My suit size in 44 -46 regular,, that's between M & L according to the chart. I must say the vest was very nice, sending it back to re-order Other than the sizing issue which many others have already commented on (I'm a XL/2XL but got the 3XL and it fit ok), I really can't complain about this vest.  I bought this to be used as part of a steam punk costume and with a few minor additions, this worked out great.  I used a steamer to get out the creases it arrived with.  If I had to pick on one thing, it would be that the buttons are held on by just a few threads and they feel really flimsy...  as if they would just pull right off if given a moderate tug.  Hopefully, this will not happen the first time i wear it. I ordered my husband a size large based on the reviews which said to size up. He usually wears a medium and this was too big for him. So I say that the sizes are very accurate. The quality of the material is not the best, it is very thin and the back adjuster wouldn't stay in place. However, it worked just fine for his Halloween costume. I wouldn't recommend this if you are wearing it for work though. It's a beautiful color and design and it arrived exactly as shown. Fits as it should. The medium I got might even be considered largish around the stomach. I'm 6'2"" and weight 170 (cross country and wrestling coach) so i am fairly thin and with the vest sinched up all the way it was still a bit loose, bit overall was nice. Vest looks amazing--nice fabric used on the front half with a beautiful print. Overall quality of stitching is decent, back material and size adjustment strap and hardware are below average quality, but I do not wear vest often enough to likely ever wear it out. Love this thing!  Great price but it started to add up when i got the matching caveat and pocket hanky.  Careful with the sizing but this one seems closer to ""normal sizing"" specs.  I would get another yes. :)  And might in a different color. It is very thin materiel on the back but for a vest thats good as its not so hot under a jacket then. Seems well enough made. Also, its not ""brown"" its more like a cream orange but not so bright it screams at you. Classy! I bought the red paisley one for only $10 so I figured I'd take a chance on it.  The quality is better than I expected.  The only nit is that the side pockets are for show only.  I'm taking mine to a tailor to modify the vest to accommodate a pocket-watch. I like the look, but the adjustable ""belt"" thing at the back is made out of satin, so it doesn't stay put when you try to tighten it - I will have to sew it in place.  I bought it for my teenage son's Christmas Ball - seems to fit as expected (maybe a little wide, but he is a slender adult S/M size normally).",1,1

"Purchased this for my little man. He loves Paw Patrol and with the cape attached how could I deny him the pleasure of playing hero. No joke, he wore this shirt everyday for like a week! The only problem I have with the shirt is that the picture started to come off after awhile. It didn't crack, but did begin to peel off from the bottom. If I pull on it enough, then I could remove the entire picture in one piece. Perhaps drying it isn't a good idea. I would recommend skipping the dryer and just letting it air dry. This shirt is so cute and my grandson loves it!!  The fit is good - I ordered him a 5T -  he usually wears a 4T-5T so I ordered larger to allow for shrinkage.  It has  been laundered several times and still has bright color and fits good. Came quickly.  This fit my 5 year old great.  He loved the cape on the back.  After a while he hit a stage where he only wanted to wear the t-shirt part without the cape which is fine.  We will pass this to my daughter next.  Getting lots of use out of this adorable shirt! All their friends want one now too! I received the shirt on time and as soon as my son saw it he HAD to wear it right then. I usually like to wash things before they are worn but he got his way this time. It is adorable and he didn't want to take it off for bed. It fits as expected nit sure about shrinkage as I have not washed like I said. The color is very bright and it is just adorable. Fits small!!  I would recommend ordering a size up for sure. My almost 3 year old loves it. He wears it to school and outside and thinks he can fly when he wears this shirt and cape. I like the fact that it attaches to his shoulders vs goes around his neck. Purchased this for our son for his 2nd birthday party which happened to be Paw Patrol. He looooved the cape that was attached to the shirt. I brought this for my little cousin. The color of the paw patrol pups colors are off. The pups are actually way darker than the photo. Which is annoying because it will not match the other paw patrol items I brought for him for Christmas. I understand its a steal but I was hoping for the colors to be true to the actual cartoon characters.",1,1
"I have a box of old IDE hard drives dating back to the 90's. Most are Western Digital, some Maxtor, in various sizes from 6 GB to 250 GB. At the time these were considered huge storage capacities. I purchased this FIDECO unit to recover the data on these drives then to wipe the drives using a DOD level wipe so that they'd be fully erased prior to disposal. The good news is this device,actually works as advertised! Amazing little box this is. I got this for ‘in case technology fails me’.. we’ve all been there. Based on the trial run I did to see how it worked- it’s going to be easy to keep all my pictures and files protected. Easy to use, great security for just in case. picked up all my old hard drive pretty fast Works fine , does what it is supposed to do . Helped me go through a stack of old drives . I would recommend  for the DYI builder , like myself . The connection is very fast and is a good tool for my work. Works well and it’s pretty solid. this was a better product than I expected I am very happy with it and will be getting another one read speed good!",1,1
Shop will not honor the purchase and cancel it immediately after purchase. Ask u to go down shop if want to get the price that was stated.  Fake deal.  Be careful.  Not sure why Lazada allow this shop to continue in their online site. Received it fast and well packaged. Well priced,-1,-1
"Is it amazing and luxurious? I would say no. Is it well-crafted, easy to use, and practical? Absolutely. The pillows alone are very nice and the box functions as it should. Glass is all in one piece as well. It is definitely worth the money and has me on my way to starting my watch collection. Great watch case. Never intended to be a watch collector seen nice watches here on Amazon from Invicta and own 5 now, needed a place to put my watches. Excellent price, outstanding quality for the price. Wonderful display case. Great price Good looking and lots of space, even for large watches. Loved the watch box, exactly what was advertised.  Looking forward to wrapping it as a gift. Pretty cool and a nice way to organize and display my watches.  It has also been a good way to hold my other jewelry and accessories. very nice and well put together great box",1,1
"I purchased this box on a lightning deal and won't ever buy it for the lower price again just because the majority of the selection wasn't great. My husband and I, both vegan, were introduced to one new type of chip that we definitely want more of.  The skinny onion flavored veggie sticks were very good.  They are like funions but better because they aren't all oily and do taste better. From what I remember funions tasting like anyway.  Half the selection was things we had tried before or were just really plain for the price of the box.  Id definitely say the assortment is overpriced. If it was like a dollar a bag or less, we would be signed up for a bimonthly subscription for it most likely just because they are healthy and good to grab on the way out the door. Looking for healthy snacks. These were Vegan. But each bag maybe had a palm full of snack in them. I mean, a ridiculously small amount, maybe a fifth of the bag was product and crumbs at that. Taste was OK, but probably not worth the money. Won't order again. Here's what's in a freshly opened bag of wasabi rice chips for example. The breakfast bars, granola bars, and assorted healthful chips/popcorn were great. The only complaint would be that the dried corn kernel snack and others similar to it (space-food like dried vegetables/fruits) not that great since they are both not filling and sort of hard to eat. I understand they probably don't want to put more chip size bags in (because they take up too much space) or granola bars (already quite a lot of bars), so perhaps they could think about fruit roll up type snacks or blueberry chocolate snacks, which are thinner profile in the bags. Products came in a nice package not smooshed. That's the only good news. Out of all the items I was supposed to receive here are the list of what I received and what I did not receive and the ""substitutes"" my husband is stationed overseas and this is a great package for him. Everything got there quickly and my husband sure enjoyed it.. Hello David- I was looking for vegan snacks for my grandson and came across your product.  He is being raised vegan, and I checked with my daughter if she would like to try the product.  She said okay, but he wasn't able to eat or try everything because he had just turned 2.  She had him try a few chips and he liked it.  We were just cautious about him choking.  The Terra chips were good but a bit hard for him to chew. Now he is 2 1/2 and likes them. The older sister takes snacks to school which she likes. I hold a professional services workshop and have been looking for an easy-to-manage snack box with healthy treats in it.  This completely fits the bill, and my workshop participants seem to enjoy the quality and selection.  I like that these are primarily ""name brand"" treats. I've sampled a few of the healthier choices and found them to be very good--taste and texture.  I'll be sticking with these for my workshops! Great way to try different snacks, the assortment makes it more likely that someone in your home/office will find something they like. Items are not stale and they are packaged well, so they arrive without damage.",1,1

"First, I did not receive these products for free, I bought them. The Simply Calphalon was rated a best buy by CR and I thought that the specs for the Kitchen Aid made them worth consideration. I have been in the restaurant business for over 30 years so I have a lot of experience with pans, mostly professional sets. So that is my point of reference. The Calphalon and Kitchen Aid are in the same mid-range price point (150 - 200). Truthfully they are very similar but not equal. Nice, heavy cookware set.  The anodized coating is durable and definitely non-stick. The pans heat evenly and have truly flat bottoms (important if you have a smoothtop electric range).  Only downside is that the handles transmit too much heat.  You will need hotpad gloves with these. Using it with induction cook-top. All works well. Not very happy with specific pan selections. 8"" skillet and  1.5-quart saucepan are kind of useless, I guess it increases the number pieces. Also note that the set does not include large skillet. Had to buy a separate 12 inch skillet. Best value. Cheaper than Calfphalone, but better quality. Overall it looks nicer than Calphalone contemporary. Has a dull, dark, elegant finish, and nice metallic steel handles....just like a higher end product. I've been enjoying this new set for about two weeks.  Each piece is solid and when they say non-stick they mean it!  I'm so impressed. The last set I had was good - this is so much better.  I'm trying to only wash by hand, which is really easy (did I mention that the non-stick coating is great) but I don't feel too guilty if I put them in the dishwasher knowing they're safe there. Quality product for a great price. I waited about three months to get these shipped. But as soon as they arrived I noticed they are an awesome quality. They heat fast and keep it longer than other pans I had. Great cookware!...better than more expensive brands I've owned...its nonstick and cleans easily...the only downfall is that the handles get hot, but I'm still very happy overall Buy this. It is a great pan.  We use it and wash it every day and it has held up perfectly.",1,1

"Great shirt, got it as part of a V-Day gift for my girlfriend. Great quality! Only issue was that it had a glue type substance on it that I had to wipe off with a wet rag and then threw it in the wash. No more glue just thought it was odd, don’t know if it was the wax coating or not. Overall nice shirt!! Great quality and great gift Beautiful color and design but was too small... I usually wear a men’s L but I buy an XL. Purchased a 2XL so I can wear it like a dress, but it fit snug",1,1
"Great cable. I have dozens of guitar cables and have used hundreds or thousands as a studio and live sound tech, from the likes of Mogami, Monster, ProCo, Canare, Fender, Radio Shack, Monoprice, etc etc etc... Just got back into guitar after a 20 year break, and started gearing up again. This past year, I bought this Kirlin cable, a Hosa cable, a GLS Audio cable, and a Seismic Audio cable.  Of the bunch, this Kirlin is my favorite -- it's clear that the metal connector design and the strain reliefs are designed for heavy duty usage. The cable thickness is also the largest diameter of the 4 I bought, and the weave of the braid is tight. Overall, if I had to guess which cable was going to last the longest, I'd guess this one. It will last forever used just my house; if I were to ever start gigging again, I'd guess it would last at least a few years of hard gigging, or quite a few years of light gigging. That said, this was also the most expensive of the above cables -- by just a few dollars, sure, but if you absolutely know the cable won't be subject to much abuse, the Hosa or GLS Audio also seem great without compromising too much on quality. The Hosa is my second favorite; seems a bit more durable than the GLS Audio. The Seismic Audio is the style I used to buy in high school -- definitely wouldn't rely on it for gigging, but it should be fine for most practice session use. After 6 months of very light use, the right angle connector sleeve fell apart. The threaded sleeve section broke free from the plug section. Apparently, this was a simple friction fitted joint which is not suitable for use as an instrument cable. This is not what I expect from a ""Premium"" cable. I'm very disappointed and it cannot be returned or exchanged because it's beyond Amazon's return period. Buyer beware. I will attempt to have it repaired or replaced via the Limited Lifetime Warranty and see if the manufacturer will honor it. I have owned a lot of different guitar cables through the years, but never tried Kirlin brand. After looking for a backup cable to take to a friends house for practice, I decided to go with this highly ranked cable. Turns out, I really like this cable!  The heavy-duty connectors are especially well-built (as is the entire cable). As with many items on Amazon, the price can vary considerably at any given time- glad I waited and purchased when the cost was relatively low. Upon receiving it and being impressed, I bought a second one. Highly recommended. Resistance is next to perfect per my tester, signal transmission is strong to my amp and this allows accurate reproduction of my acoustic guitar(s) which is the one thing I require from my guitar cords.  The braided cover adds some stiffness between instrument and amp and I would say longevity of the cable.  The stress relief heat shrinking at the plugs should also aid in longevity.  I am suitably impressed and will when needing to add other cables, more than likely order several more. Love this cable! I bought a purple (red & blue knitted) one and a green one. Both look great, sound clean, and work fantastic. I only need to stand a few feet away from my amp, so I'm good with 10 feet. But wanted to point out its not super long. If you like to walk around....get a longer one. I have purchased just about every kind of cable out there and this by far is the best for the money I have yet to purchase. This cable seems well made, and study. The connectors fit great in my Taylor, and every board I've plugged into. I haven't had it long enough to see how is going to hold up over time, but so far so good. I'm going to order a longer one too. I was a little disappointed that it didn't have the full specs for performance on the packaging, but it didn't seem to harm the overall sound of my guitar much, unlike b some cables I've bought that just killed the cleanliness of the signal. Great price on this cable.",1,1
"I bought this item in May of 2016 and, initially, it worked as expected on Windows 10. I have several IDE and SATA drives of different sizes and was able to swap them out to copy old files etc. After a couple of months I noticed that the red light on the adapter (indicating connection to the host PC) would only light after jiggling the USB connector. Then after a few more uses, I had to tilt the USB connector at a slight angle to the body of the adapter to get a connection. Now, I can't get a connection at all. The USB connector in the adapter wiggles up and down. I popped off the cover of the adapter (very easy) and saw that where the USB connector was soldered to the circuit board had failed. All the the contacts on the USB connector had lifted from the circuit board. The whole body of the connector was loose. This thing is great. You can basically connect every hard drive there is and access it without being throttled by a slow USB 2.0 connection. Fast IDE/PATA drives doing 60MB/s as well as SATA drives doing 150MB/s will work just fine at those speeds with it. All the drives I've tested were just as fast through USB 3.0 as they are connected internally to the PC. So there are a few bad reviews saying the power supply destroys things, so before I plugged it into anything important, I measured the output voltages with a multimeter.  The power supply that came with it is Flypower MODEL SPP34-12.0/5.0-2000. Over the past month, I actually came to the point of ordering this Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter, then backed away, several times, before I went ahead and ordered this. Then I opened the package and found that the directions were very poor and the photos in the directions just as bad. However, once I got it working, it worked fantastically great. Much better than I thought it would before I bought it. I used this on three different hard drives that I was about to destroy and dispose of because I had no hope of getting them to work or retrieving important info from them. With this, each of the three old hard-drives opened easily, and I was able to save important irreplaceable info.  In fact this Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter I would have easily given it a 5 for the performance of it's job! But the poor directions and photos in the directions were totally inexcusable. I wasn't able to get this adapter to read an old IDE iMac drive from 2005, but I was able to transfer files from a 2011 iMac SATA drive to a current Windows 10 machine using a translate program to go between the two file systems. Your neighbors will feel like you have a super power as you recover family pictures from hard drives trapped in long dead PCs (most likely due to either PSU or motherboard failure). The USB 3.0 adapter let me transfer files from one SATA drive at around 90 MB/s, which isn't all that bad when it comes to getting files back that were once considered lost forever.",-1,-1
"Absolutely love this charger.. I've been using it for the last 9 months with no issues. I use this as my home charger and it plugs in at my bed side and stretches all the way across my queen size bed and I love it. I said I would only write a review if something happened to the charger and it finally did, my charging pin that plugs into the phone broke (all my fault). My phone dropped out of my hand phone it was charging and dropped right onto my wooden floors on the charging piece and broke off inside the hole. First things first, always buy a MFi certified accessory for your apple products. I've bought four of these now that the longer links and I really love them.  They offer versatility so that you are not stuck next to a wall outlet because of the longer length.  The only issue I have encountered is that after a few months, the rubber covering the cord tends to pull apart exposing wires. It still works but I havent found a way to fix the problem. Tape doesn't work and I can't glue it so this would be the only drawback. I haven't had this issue with Apple's charging cords but they are SO $$. So I'll keep keep buying these. I've only had these sync cables for a few weeks so it's really too soon to give an accurate evaluation. Be that as it may so many times within just weeks other sync cables were all heading for trouble or just plain failed. I've tried all the different gimmicky versions and none of them lasted long including those ridiculously priced OEM cables. But I've always had good luck with IXCC cable. They're well built, don't start breaking at the junction of the cable and the connector like the rigid cables tend to do. Admittedly I'm pretty tough on my cables so I'm looking for the cable that can handle it best. IXCC cables have all worked well for me. Oh they'll fail at some point but at least they've lasted longer already than some I have used. Plus they have an 18 month warranty. I've purchased probably about 10 different cables from iXCC. There are 4 of us in the house. And we all have unique charging needs. For example, as my daughter goes off to college, we needed a longer cord for her to reach her loft bed. In my wife's car, we have the USB charging plug under the arm rest so she needs a little more length while my other daughter's car has the plug in the console and needs a shorter cable. It's this flexibility that has really helped us. The cables are well made and work as advertised. And so much less expensive than original Apple cables. I bought this 2.5 years ago and have used it without any issues. Until the day my 65 year old mother was driving my car and went to plug the cable into her phone...and it almost burned her finger because it was so hot. She immediately unplugged it and we tried multiple cables in the charging port to ensure it was this iXCC cable at fault and not the port. BEWARE. Unequivocally the best charging cable available. I use my iPhone a lot. I mean for hours. I leave it plugged in otherwise it would be drained. I've noticed that A) Most cables wear out first at the where the base of the connector meets the wire. B) Lately, the less well made cables, even when ""certified"" do not have a snug fit of the lightening connector into my iPhone 6. So any slight movement and it vibrates on and off and goes from charging to not charging and back and forth. This is irritating to say the least. It has a pop-up message that it isn't compatible or some such thing and requires manual dismissing. This can really interfere with getting much work done.",1,1
"I read other reviews and saw that I needed to size up if I was in between sizes so I did and it works well for me. I work in public service and wanted something I could wear to work so I didn't risk losing my ring on duty. I'm still getting used to the feeling of the silicone and sometimes it irritates my middle finger when it rubs against it throughout the day, but overall I don't have any issues with it. The colors are bright and dirt wipes off easily. I purchased this for my husband to wear at work.  He is getting it for Christmas in a week so I can update the review once he opens it up!  I did try it on my thumb which is a size 9.  It is a little snug but because it is silicone I imagine it will expand.  It looks just as pictured and I am excited for him to have a ring that he can wear while on duty. got a size bigger than my ring size per a suggestion, and fits fine. Great product like Bought this for my Husband and he loves it. When he got it it fit a bit snug but after wearing it for a few days it loosened up and now he says it fits comfortably. Have to reorder twice because it runs very small. I didn't bother to return it. So, I just reordered it. awesome fits great",1,1
I hear birds I couldn't hear before. It is a really good spy gadget I,1,1
"Exactly as pictured. First off let me let it be known that I am a female and I bought if for myself. My fingers are a little on the big/plump side and the regular female rings either don't come in my size or do not look good. It says for men, but I believe they are unisex. They are a little on the tight side for my ring finger, size 9.5 but I know that a 10 would be too big. I like the simple but classic look of these. These are simple, durable, affordable wedding bands.  At least the silver one should have a very long life.  I don't know what gives the gold and black ones their color, or how long it will take for that color to wear off and show the stainless steel underneath.  At least when they are new, no one can tell these aren't white and yellow gold. Backup wedding ring that I can fit in my pocket.  Great thing about these is I don't have to worry about losing them because its so cheap.  One feedback is they're a bit thick compared to my real wedding ring but thats probably just my own personal preference They look nice, but the black one has only been worn twice and the color is coming off. Totally disappointed. That was the only ring that was not in plastic packaging and did not have the sticker around it, so I'm assuming it was used and returned by someone, and resold to me. Super disappointed when I saw that.  But. I guess you get what you pay for! Silver and gold are holding up nicely at least. It fit perfectly and looks dope on me. I love it. It will last very long I was looking for cheap rings that would work as props for a D&D campaign, and these work well for that. The sizing is accurate enough, too, they fit my fingers well enough (I'm about a 10.5 but I went for an 11 just to be safe, and they were in fact just slightly big on me). They really do look quite nice though, my roommate got the same rings (for the same purposes) and actually wears it around once in a while. These rings are awesome for the price. I only wear the silver because you can barely tell there are scratches once you've had it for a while. The black is pretty cool for the first week but eventually it gets scratched and looses its color. The gold obviously looks fake and scratches too. Overall these rings are doing their job and at the end of the day they deserve a good review and that's why I give them 4 stars. Nice ring set.  Makes it easy to coordinate wedding bands with attire.  The size I ordered fit me perfectly and as expected.",1,1

"I got this lapbook mainly for my elementary school kids so they can do their online homework.  It serves its purpose, meaning my kids use this one rather than our main laptop.  It is, however,  a lot smaller than expected, even though they provided the dimensions in the description.  The charging chord is short, so to use it while charging, you need to be very close to a power outlet.  Other than that it's a solid computer that my kids can use.   I know I will have a lot to learn when it comes to operating this laptop. I have had a desktop computer for years and have always been a desktop and big laptop user. I took a chance and purchased fusion5 laptop and so far I found it reliable and easy to use. I will write again to let you know how I am getting along with my new laptop. I'm sure I will be fine and as happy as can be! First and foremost, this is so light and thin. Clever design with no compromise in performance. Screen colors are vivid and supports full HD. The screen is 10x times better than my old laptop. It takes a bit of use to understand how mouse pad works but once you get the trick, it is so useful to have those shortcuts. I am attaching a video which provided so much information. I have not tested a memory card yet but I am planning to purchase a 128gb card which I was been told works great. Happy to rate this five stars. Update 2/1/2018 (10 months of ownership): I began noticing intermittent errors with the keyboard input starting two months ago, but today the error became so bad as to render the keyboard unusable. Frankly, for a machine to not even make it a year before being besieged by problems does not bode well and I've lost 80% of the faith I had in this machine. Pros: Lightweight, Microsoft Office equipped *The device does come with the Office Suite but WITHOUT a subscription*",1,1
"This is not 100% leather. Mostly plastic with a thin layer of leather. Looks really fake. Also the look is horrible, since they didnt put any grommets at the buckle end. It looks stupid. Received belt and grommets did not extend all but 3/4 of the belt, leaving roughly 8 inches of space. Love this belt! perfect length - I wear a size 16 and an XL fit me perfectly. I was looking for an adjustable belt to wear with jeans and this fit the bill.  It was a great bargain and it’s a nice, sturdy belt and it is nice because I can use it smaller at the waist or larger at the hips for low rise jeans. After trying to find a double grommet white leather belt for some time, I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon's website!  I love it! Fantastic Belt! Fits Me Pretty Good. I Ordered This For A Halloween Costume & Really Liked It!! Packaged Really Well & Was Very Easy To Open!! Finally, a useable belt that actually keeps my pants up. The fact that the rivets go all the way around means I'm not going to buy another as I move down sizes. I had this belt years ago and lost it somewhere. I liked it so much that I was really happy when I found the same belt! It's very functional - I love how the design is the holes to close the belt.",1,1

"Item arrived nicely packaged and on time. The unit is easy to fill with water and to use. It does produce a good amount of steam in a very short period of time and did a good job on the clothing. Due to its size and weight it was no problem traveling with it. Very good purchase so far. I absolutely love this. I keep it in my office so I can use it if my shirt or jacket gets wrinkled throughout the day. It is so easy to take it on the go. I can't wait to take it with me on my next business trip. I hate when my shirts are wrinkled when I unpack my suitcase. I ordered this steamer for the sole purpose of blocking my knitting and crocheting. I'm sure it works well for clothes, but it's excellent for the reason I'm using it! I pinned my shawl to a blocking board first, to get it to the shape I needed. Then I passed the steamer over it (about half an inch from the shawl) to get the yarn to relax to maintain the shape. The yarn I used was a bamboo/silk blend. Perfection! I would highly recommend this steamer :) Awesome little guy. Heats up fast. Water tank is relatively small but with it filled, box says it will steam up to 10 minutes. Very portable and light and even comes with its own satchel. On-off switch, so it’s easy and non complicated to use. I have always wanted a steamer and this little guy is perfect for our household. I hate doing laundry and don't even own an iron so I was having the throw anything wrinkled back in the dryer which takes way more time. This little fella heats up pretty fast and gets the job done. Also being portable(small) it doesn't take up space that we couldn't afford to loose! The only thing that would make it better would be if you could turn the steam on and off instead of having it constantly run until the water gets to low. Great steamer! Heats up very fast, perfect size and is easy to use! This has been handy to use on shirts that were pressed, but got a little wrinkled in my closet. Instead of pulling out the iron and ironing board to do a touch up I  just plug this in and I'm done!  I'm definitely taking it with me the next time I travel. I like the small size of this steamer and the fact that it heats up really quickly and is lightweight.  However, right from the start using distilled water (not tap water), every 30 seconds or so, it STOPS (i.e., it seems to ""turn off"" and the water stops boiling, the steam stops coming out), and I have to stand there and wait what seems like another 30 seconds (I haven't timed it). I've only used it a few times but manages to get a few pairs of drapes steamed, which is why I bought it. I was tired of ironing these long drapes on an ironing board!  However, it does not work as well as ironing and takes a long time ... I'm not sure what the problem is as I read the instructions and troubleshooting guide - this should only happen after using tap water for a while and having the minerals clog it up. But it did this from the start and again, only used distilled water and only used it 3 times. I like this portable steamer so that I can take it with me when going on vacation. Its light weight and doesn’t take up room when traveling. It also does a good job in steaming my clothes so they are wrinkle free when on vacation.",1,1

"Great hats!  My husband and I each got one.  He used his in hard rain the other day, and it kept him dry as a bone.  This is a great hat for keeping the rain off of your glasses, so you can see :) Just received this hat and love it! I like the color and it is a handsome hat. The brim was actually a little larger than I expected which for me was good. I tend to like the brim flat all around, but the front curved down slightly as shown in the image. The wire in the brim makes it easy to shape. One slight issue is that though the hat fits nicely, it feels like a stiff sudden wind would blow it away, so I recommend not removing the chin strap. Overall a nice hat and can't wait to hit the trail with it this weekend! I wore this hat last weekend for a DJ set & it did a great job at keeping the lasers and projections out of my eyes. The brim also created a nice barrier around the circumference of my head preventing anyone from kissing me for any longer than a short peck. Although no one said anything, I'm pretty sure I saw a few vegans grin because it wasn't made of leather. I received many complements about the hat. I'm not a big fan of the elastic inner band in any hat & this isn't really any exception although it did seem to do a good job at absorbing any sweat... I got the XL based on other reviews of sizing - I am about a 7 5/8... With all my hair I probably should have gone with the XXL although this size does work & isn't overly uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. I do feel like it squeezes my head enough that I have to take it off for a breather every few hours but most hats do especially if they have elastic inner bands. I also feel the need to pull it down to the point where the center almost pops up a bit but also it looks fine and stays on my head without my head that deep in it. Very solid black hat that is appropriate to wear during my day job as a stage hand as well as managing corporate events. It doesn't seem to get too hot in the sun or in a sweaty rave. The outer pleather band does look sort of cheap but really I wouldn't expect anything better from a hat this price & the metal button thing seems to make up for it. Solid construction and classic styling make this hat the perfect choice for a hardworking man who needs both a functional yet presentable hat for daily wear. This is my second purchase of the same style hat. The new brown seems to be darker than the last one I ordered but that should not present problem unless you are trying to match it to a previously purchased oilskin coat. It fits nicely according to size and is made even more comfortable by the inner band and side grommets which allow sufficient air flow across the top of the head. It holds its original color well and does not bleach out in the sun. The handy ties can simply be worn behind or tucked up into the hat when not needed -- but they will spare you the frustration and embarrassment of having to chase your hat across the field or parking lot in a stiff wind! The Kodiak hat is effectively rain repellent and the darker hat does not show dirt or grime if you are working in a more rugged environment. I like that the hat is easily cleaned simply by rinsing it off with a standard garden hose with spray nozzle and allowing to dry naturally in the open air. If necessary, Outback Trading offers a product that will allow the hat to easily be ""re-treated"" to restore water repellent feature, as well. The durability of this hat cannot be overemphasized! It holds up under serious use, and has a remarkable ""bounce-back"" capacity which allows it to retain its shape and good looks. First, I selected fits as expected..... this is only because I listened to the reviewers these do come large to be clear I am a 21 3/4 ok I was right in between small and large I bought the small.  It fits great the crown is a little shorter than I would like but it fits so well I can't begin to complain, it has a small pocket in the crown, can be hand molded to your liking, and i usually don't like chin straps but this one is made right so when I don't need them I just let it ride down the back of my ears.  This is a great product very high quality and is a head turner, I have been wearing hats like this for years and this is by far the nicest and they have a great price, this hat could easily sell for 30%-40% more.  It is a great deal for a superb hat, I highly recommend this hat.  Keep in mind this is an oil skin hat so it will take a couple of days to break in, just wear it......",1,1
"(This review should have been posted back in January, 2017.) Leather in real life doesn't have the ""drapey"" quality as shown on website. Overall for the price, this could have been a very good bargain, but after only a few times of wearing it, coating on the leather started to chip off. =( And it's very obvious because it's chipping on the front chest pockets... Was hoping this could last a good few years, but I guess this is not going to be it. Would suggest anyone who is considering it, take this into consideration. Thanks! Love this jacket. Leather is super soft and the quilted lining is really nice. 3 inside pockets. 2 large enough for a wallet or phone and one small finger pocket on the left that you could fit a lighter and chopstick in at the same time. I thought I was a small, thanks god I got a medium! Haha, I’m very pleased with my jacket. The leather is soft and supple. I'm very pleased with this jacket. I've been asked about the inner pockets, so I uploaded two pictures. The picture of the single pocket is on the inside right, and measures 7"" x 7"" with a 6.5"" opening. On the inside left, there are both a 7"" x 7"" pocket with a 6"" opening and a 2.5"" (w) x 3.5"" (d) pocket with a 2.5"" opening. The pockets are piped in leather and do not have zippers. For the cost I was very surprised on how poorly it was packaged. It came shrink wrapped in a small bag. I could not believe a men’s XL leather jacket was inside this mail pouch! It was horribly wrinkled, obviously.  Thankfully the wrinkles came out in about 5 days of hanging in my closet. It was much thinner than I thought. The leather seems genuine but lining is thin. This is a Spring or Fall jacket, not one for the cold. Husband likes the style, it is a soft leather not stiff, and it fit him well. He wears an XL so it was true to size. We will see how durable it is over time. The jacket was to small, I ordered it going by the sizing guide. I was charged 15% for returning it. This is a great jacket. I've ordered a few like it from other sellers and the sizes were way off. One I ordered based on the sizing recommended was a 3xxx and it was more like a medium. Thanks to Amazon Prime the shipping back and forth cost nothing. I'm a normal XL and I ordered an XL for this one and it fits perfectly. The jacket is a somewhat tight fit, so if you have a belly, you may want to go with a size up. Great jacket! Leather feels very soft, and it's nice and thin. I'm 5'6"" 180lb, and the body fits very snug. There is, however, a smell due to the leather, and the sleeves are a bit long, but I simply fold them inside and it's not noticeable at all. Would recommend for anyone looking for a thin, stylish, affordable leather jacket. I'm definitely going to wear this often.",1,1
"A solid 4 stars. Good overall quality, a few things could be improved. Review includes a few screenshots from 4K video.  If i read/understand correctly, this is the 2nd generation of the ek7000.  With better video/picture quality with enhance 4k video capture and the ability to have different frame rates that the previous version as well. I bought this action camera for my oldest Daughter for Christmas. She is very active and constantly on the go, and she has been requesting an under water camera for a while now. This is very similar to a Go Pro. When it takes pics the pics are much more wide, you get so much more in a photo from this than any standard camera. The pics are sharp and clear and the video is stunning. It came with 2 rechargeable batteries, which is great because she will always have that back up when she has exhausted one. I bought a class 10 64 GB Micro SD card for it. I got the one with the adapter for her so its easier and more versatile for her giving her more option to remove the pics from the camera. It does not come with the card, so you do need to purchase one for it. I bought this for a recent trip to Mexico. Last time we went, I had to buy a disposable waterproof camera for our snorkeling excursion and the photos were shitty. So this time I'm prepared. The pictures were great quality. Granted we are not professional photographers but the quality is great for us. I was really excited about all the attachments that came with this including the waterproof case but we didn't really end up using any of it. We took it out of the waterproof case and put it in a waterproof phone bag that hangs around my neck. It was small and light and worked great in the bag. Used the remote a couple of times to take pics of us together but you do have to connect it every time you turn the camera on. It connected fast. We just never needed it for the rest of the trip. I keep all the attachments in the box it came in and it's great for storage. The camera fits in it as well. I do have to say it was really a task getting the camera off the top when I first opened the packaging but aside from that very easy to use. I recommend it.",1,1

"As vices go, I consider this one to be pretty minor. Think of all the things people put in their bodies. I have avoided the big bad stuff, but I'll be kicking and screaming if I ever have to give up my International Coffee. I've been drinking one flavor or another for almost 40 years. The French Vanilla is one of the yummiest they've come out with. I should of read the description closer, which is my fault. It's powdered instant coffee mix not intended for a coffee maker.  I thought it was regular ground coffee with Vanilla flavoring. It's mostly artificial things that are not great for you. The taste isn't bad just not what I thought I was buying. Sort of thing you expect to get in the waiting room of a car repair shop We like the flavor and the consistency when we mix it with hot water.  It's also convenient when you are not in the mood for making it in the coffee maker with the grinds.  I like to a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream in mine. I am addicted to this coffee.  I take naps during the day so when I wake up I can have another cup. HA! I love this Coffee and I love the fact I can buy it in larger containers thru Amazon. BJ's stopped carrying this brand of coffee and I have been drinking it for 10 years.  I loved BJ's prices and I am now having to pay double for this same size, but I have to have my French Vanilla. Drink this every day.  Walmart the only one who carries the little canisters.  BJs used to carry the large ones but discontinued.  I drink this as my morning joe and this canister fills FOUR of those little canisters which makes it a great value. If you don't worry about weight gain and like sweet drinks, mix this with mil and lots of sugar. I love it!!",1,1
"The chair came slightly smaller than expected, but overall still love the chair. Very comfortable and easy to roll about.  Delivery came faster than expected but they made the extra effort to deliver the chair after normal working hours. Cheers to that! Assembly took place on the spot and it was done in about 10 minutes. Excellent service by UMD! Good comfortable and firm chairs. Delivery was delayed 2 weeks despite paid for Standard Delivery. I used to only trust v-hive chairs, which are about 300+ at least per pop. First time buying a more simple chair like this. And I must say I'm surprised at how comfy it is! Don't expect it to be very big tho. Won't be able to sit cross-legged on it (unless you are tiny), but that's fine.  Overall, value for money and self-assembled with my wife. (I assembled it wrongly at first haha). Loving it so far, thank you! :) I self-assembled the chair. The instructions are quite okay to follow. The chair is working very well. Had this chair for about 5-6 months now. 1 MAJOR criticism of this chair is that, for me, the back rest will keep sliding down by itself (maybe I bought a faulty product) after a while, little bit by little bit, till the back rest is no longer comfortable. As the height of the backrest can be adjusted by screwing a knob on the side to release and tighten a clamp. Also, the wheels do not roll very well Overall, good product in general, almost worth the price I bought it for.",1,1

"I cannot believe what the baby food industry can get away with honestly. The first ingredient is squash. Do you even see that on the label? Should be illegal how the labeling is so misleading. Does my kid eat it? Yes. Did I hope he was eating broccoli instead of a sweet vegetable he eats too much of anyway? Yes. I love that this pouch is just veggies, so few are. They pouch is mild tasting and contains sweeter veggies. My twins love these pouches better than any other. This a staple in our house now. This was the first intro to food we used because we didn't want them to exposed to tons of sugary fruits right away. So happy to have found it, highly recommend as a first into to foods for your baby. BEST BEST QUALITY - NO EARTH'S BEST FOOD HAS EVER BEEN REJECTED BY MY GRANDSON OR MY GREATGRANDCHILDREN (TWINS) I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but we buy this exact same kind at the store and my little guy eats them up.  The ones I ordered from Amazon he won't have anything to do with.  I opened and compared one from the store and Amazon and the Amazon one was watery and grainy and looked bad.  I tasted it and it didn't taste right either, not like it was spoiled but just not right (I understand why he won't eat them).  We have opened a few hoping they would be better but they have all been the same and I can't return them since there are a few gone (in the trash).  It's a bummer to spend $19 on something and have to throw it all away (I don't feel right about donating to the food bank either), especially since I was so excited to get these from Amazon (they rarely have more than a couple at the store and it's one of the only ones I have found without a ton of sugar). Received the product as advertised, no issues with product, expiration date, damage, etc.  My daughter loves the butternut squash & pear mix, this is one of her favorites :)  Out of all the baby food puree pouch brands Earth's Best has consistently been top quality in my experience.  My daughter has some food allergies, we've tried a lot of different brands & flavor combinations and highly recommend this one.  Price is good too.  I can sometimes get them slightly cheaper at Target when they're on sale, but the convenience of having them shipped for me beats saving $.10/pouch. So glad there is finally one that is just Veggies---I wish there were more flavors! My son loves these, but even if he didn't I wouldn't give them a bad review based on his personal preference. Also, in reference to the review that mentioned a ""bad smell"" it's Broccoli....broccoli has a certain smell! I have to agree with the other reviewers.  Earth's Best Peach Mango is very sour!  The flavor completely overpowers The rest of the ingredients.  I did detect a slight peach flavor but even that felt like artificially flavored peach. Used the pouch in December 2016 but the product expires May 2017.  Trying to make out the lot number ... I think it's H6 or W6 18:47. Adult review: smells and tastes really bad. However, this is the first baby food that I gave to both my sons when they started eating solids at 6 months of age. My sons are now 3 1/2 and 15 months and this still is their favorite flavor of pouches. They devour it, they have one almost everyday for a light snack (35 calories). There are not many organic pouches in the market that are just vegetables, so I am happy that my kids enjoy this one. Everyone tastes are different and in my family this is a keeper.",1,1

"I have an existing ASUS RT-AC5300 Router, and another old ASUS RT-AC68U as an Wireless AP that is 3 rooms away.    I decided to purchased the newer ASUS RT-AC86U so that I can participate in the current ASUS AiMesh Beta. The current ASUS AiMesh in it's Beta form is already working very well for me.  Now, I am able to enjoy excellent seamless WiFi coverage in my whole house with one AiMesh Router and 2 AiMesh Nodes with excellent performance :-) No more WiFi dead spots anymore at home! Range and throughput is incredible! I get full coverage signal on my bed even with the room door closed, and the router is in the living room beside my TV. Best router ever! WiFi coverage and signal strength has significantly improved across the house. Video streaming is smooth. It completely meets my expectations. I guess one of the key different is the desk space required for this RT-AC86U and RT-AC88U. I like the standing looking router which save space on the desk or TV console where most ppl will place the router. By the spec, I would say RT-AC86U have a faster processor of 1.8GHz to. The need of 4 or 8 LAN port for the 2 model depend on individual need. Item received in good condition and delivered within 2 days from order",1,1

"Snap backs are very convenient anymore and seems to be the ""In thing"" in today's trends! My spouse loves this style of RVCA hats. He's had the grey/ white one for two months now and it's still in great shape so I purchased him the black/ charcoal two weeks ago and it's the same quality. Definitely would recommend. I bought the charcoal grey version of this.  It arrived packaged very nicely and in perfect condition.  It fits exactly as you would expect a baseball cap to fit.  I own many hats and despite almost all of them being snapbacks, they do not all fit or feel the same.  This one fits my head just the way I like.  The material on this one is a little bit thin compared to the black one I have. It is not as 'strudy' feeling as most other hats typically are, but that's what I like most about it- it is noticeably lighter.  I tend to wear this one more than my others and the material seems to breathe well.  I'm tempted to buy a second, in case they decide to discontinue this one.  I've worn this hat at least once a week for nearly 6 months and it has held up very well.  The material has stayed quite clean, considering my hands tend to get dirty all the time.  I'm a mechanic, so im sure you get the jist.  Great product.  Probably my favorite hat right now.  Definitely recommended! The quality is good and it fit as expected. The only thing is i was expecting it to be all black but it was green under the visor. They should put it in the description or have a picture. Other than that I love the hat. Great hat, fits well and doesn't fade easily. One thing to note is the underside of the bill is green just in case you didn't notice. *The green surprisingly works well with most outfits. I like the colors/style, but wow these flat bill tall crown hats just don't fit my melon at all!  I look like a clown with a billboard on my head.  I returned it, still on a mission for a new white hat. I always buy rvca hats and got this for the 2nd time but somehow is larger, don't know why. Still material and everything is good, just a little bit larger.",1,1

"I was in need of a pair of shoes to do yard work in and things around the house that I could easily slide on and off so I ordered these. I am normally a size 7, sometimes 7.5 and I ordered these in grey in size 7. These shoes fit perfectly! These are very comfortable shoes and even though I ordered them for yard work I have actually been wearing them out. I received these shoes yesterday and they are wonderful for gardening or wearing out and about.  I really love the gray...casual and comfortable but elegant.  I usually wear a size 9.5 or 10 and the 10 fit perfectly.  Thanks so much for a great product. Love my new lightweight shoes!! I wish I'd purchased 2 or 3 pair! They're perfect for working in the garden. Fits without socks on. I tried 3 other brands of clog similar to these. Garden crocks well they are better then that I have worn them to the stores to work and I get compliments all the time I love them 6 stars I just received these yesterday and when I first out then on I wasn't sure if I would like them as my These are great for taking the dog out or moving the garbage cans -- especially when the grass is wet which is pretty often here in the sunshine state.

"I purchased these bags in May, 2017 as a replacement for C style bags for an old Eureka Mighty Mite vacuum cleaner. They were listed as being replacements for the C style bags. I didn't get a chance to try to install one until today and discovered that they are indeed NOT replacements for the C bags.They do NOT fit my Mighty Mite. The cardboard on the end is too large and the hole in the cardboard is also too large. Seller needs to ensure that when they advertise a ""replacement"" product it actually replaces the item they say it does. I waited too long to return them, past the firm's replacement date. In short, these bags do NOT work with an Eureka Mighty Mite. These bags do not fit my Eureka MityMite; it's an older model. The general shape is OK, but the cardboard holder is too large.  I had to cut it down to make it fit  and then fill the spaces around the bag with pieces of cut cardboard to prevent dirt from getting sucked into the motor. The Mighty Mite Vacuum these are made for is a real workhorse. It's light, but powerful. So ours gets a lot of use. It's nice to be able to order bags that fit, without going on a great hunt to see who has stock locally. Great buy and price. Bought these with my Eureka Mighty Mite canister vacuum so I would have them on hand when needed. It was a great deal to have what I needed and I already know the bags themselves will be great since they are for my machine. Just what i needed for my older mighty mite canister vac, so glad i found them Very affordable, and hold up to drywall dust. Great bags for a great vacuum! Great hard to find bags for the great Eureka Mighty Mite!! Works great and keeps my vintage vacuum working like new!",-1,-1

"Quality is amazing. I have $200 nike flyknit racers in which the support was horrible no stability whatsoever and the sole was awfully constructed it move around to the inside and outside of the foot. These, however, is everything Id expect a flyknit running shoe to be. Right out the bag I slipped these on and I felt them lock down to my feet. I took a jog with them around my park and they felt great. With every step I felt support and felt my heel well cushioned. They look exactly like the picture I liked the design so much I didn't even want to get them dirty but needless to say I will definitely purchase more of these soon. These are better than the $200 flyknit nike shoes which always disappoint but these are quality they are made in the usa too so you know you're getting quality. This shoe has quality material the entire shoe is made out of cushioned knit so the comfort is 10/10 I cannot find anything negative about the shoe yet. As far as sizing I have in between wide to narrow feet I went true to size and they felt perfect breaking in them only took about a half hour and seriously a half hour and they molded to my feet. I didn't even want to take them off. For the price, I can guarantee you get more than what you pay for. Other athletic shoe brands will not exist for me anymore as long as this one is on the market!!! At first when I saw them I thought no way they are made for running. As I used them the first time it was on a small hike. They fit real comfortable and they didn't tear or anything since to me they look simply made. The second time I took them running and the only issue I had was that I felt almost every rock I stepped on. At some point some little plant needles went through the bottom of the shoe. Keep in mind that I was running in mountain area where there is more debris on the road then a normal city side walk. I would also like to mention if you plan on going in dirt or sand. The shoe is made up a mesh material which allows small grains of sand to go in.. Even just as a daily walking or work sho These shoes are really comfortable and surprisingly durable. I went hiking with them and was scared they were going to fall apart but they didn't and surprisingly held up really well. I even work in them and my feet do not hurt at the end of my week. I'll be ordering more of these in the future Hello Tianui have ever been so happy with low-price shoe like these. They literally feel likes socks while having plenty of grip - plus, they slide and tie right on! I have a bit of a wider foot, and I still wouldn't trade them for a fancy pair. Nice and confortable for walking around house, work, school and short walks. It's good for boating and going to the beach. I had the shoes on while i took a deep in the ocean and rinsed them with fresh water after, they also dried well afterward. I totally recommend them. Great for the value. I would be buying another pair. Make sure to order a size larger than yours if you like it be not too tight. This shoe is great! Lightweight and breathable just as advertised. It is a little smaller near the toe than I anticipated so if I buy another I'll probably go one size up but otherwise it's great. very light and comfortable shoe, great item for the price very light and comfortable, well buy more of their products!!!!",1,1
"I picked this up knowing that I would be downloading alot on my new WII U. The initial install was easy and if you feel uncomfortable about messing with the cords and your confused on what to do, don't worry, it also comes with extremely easy instructions on how to set up your new hardrive on your new system. I have already downloaded a handful of full retail games and some of the other smaller games through the Nintendo E-Shop and I have had no problems whatsoever. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to worry about the space they have on the system. The product could not have been easier to set up and functions flawlessly. I wish I had gotten this a long time ago. You have to have it to play Breathe of the Wild on a Wii U. This thing is fantastic! I was very happy with the size. I bought this to accompany my Wii U and it doesn't disappoint. Now I have all the room I need for my downloads. It was very easy to set up. Just plug the USB cord into the Wii U and plug in the power. Once you turn on the system the Wii U will format it. One should note that even though it is a 1 terabyte hard drive you will actually have around 895 gigabytes. I can't remember the actual number but apparently 1 terabyte is not 1000 gigabytes which I didn't know before this. At any rate is should be the only hard drive I need for the Wii U and it's nice that it is basically portable. I brought this to free up some space on my Wii U as I have A LOT of downloaded games from the Nintendo eShop and boy does this do the trick. It was easy to install and it's running with no problem. It even comes with an AC Adapter so that you can run external power to it and not take up both of the USB ports on the back of the Wii U. Anyone who is lookinf to free up space ob their Wii U, this is the thing to get I was really skeptical of this item as so many name brand external hard drives had already failed.  For this item to be described as physically smaller with 2 TB memory  and as 3.0 USB seemed too good to be real. I can't recall seeing this name brand before so I took a chance.  Suffice it to say, it arrived in a nice, small box.  It is as described and works perfectly for our 32GB WII U.  We have enjoyed it for a couple of months now and there has not been any hiccups in our gaming or loading of games.  Thank you. Works flawless with the wiiu, very (very!) easy to install, then transfer all your saved games and digital games to the portable hard disk and voila!!, you can play with no problem. Recommended product AA+ I was running out of space from the Black Wii U. I have some very large digital games I got from Club Nintendo a few years back. I don't need to plug the AC Adapter. The USB port works fine as a power source. Games with small memory stays in the Wii U, Larger ones goes to the Storage Device. Now I can purchase the digital games without running out of space. Works great on the wii u so far. very pleased with the product. I was worried i wouldnt be able to use my ethernet lan adaptor and the hard drive at same time but it has no issues.i plugged the y cable for the hard drive in the back of the wii u and just use the front usb slot in the front for the lan adaptor. Just make sure to have ur wii u off when u connect everything for the first time.",1,1
"Love the shoes ! They came early !!! I was so nervous it wouldn't arrive in time. But it did! These are my favorite! I will be ordering silver soon So far I love these! I haven't worn them much yet, but I really love them. The shipping came within maybe 2 days, very fast! They are lightweight and similar to Nike Free Runs. I usually take an 8, so that's what I ordered. I could've gotten away with a 7.5 but the 8's aren't horribly big. The glitter doesn't shed, which is a plus. Someone made a comment about them being stiff, they surely aren't for running or have much support but they also aren't name brand expensive shoes. For the price, these are great and super fashionable! These shoes are great! They fit true to size, they are super sparkly and best of all- they are actually comfortable. My co-workers loves them so much, they ordered their own. For the price, you can’t beat them. I’m not sure how they will hold up where your foot creases the shoe when walking, but 2 weeks in, there is no visible cracking or missing glitter. My only complaint is that my feet get hot in them as there is no ventilation.  They are amazing and I highly recommend! Omg!!!! These are awesome!!! I saw someone who recommended I purchase them in a local boutique, they didn’t have my size.... or half sizes!!!! These are sooo amazing. I constantly get comments on them! The fit is great!!! These are the perfect casual shoe to spice up your outfit. Comfy and cute. Well I am writing a review after purchasing my third pair ( bought 2 pairs earlier for my daughters ages 11 and 18 and after seeing theirs bought myself a pair). These are super fun shoes and all three  of us get compliments on our shoes when we wear them! I wear a 9-9.5 shoe normally and I ordered the 9 also ordered true size for my daughters and all three pairs fit true to size. They are not too narrow so there is comfort and they are super light weight. Really nice shoes. They seem comfortable & the glitter doesn't come off. Highly recommend, they're like no other!! 😀😀👍👍 Pretty fast shipping. VERY comfortable like walking on a cloud I was actually quite surprised. True to size, at least for me. And of course they are gorgeous. I want more colors now!!",1,1
"I have been a loyal Tide user pretty much my whole life but, man, did Persil blow it out of the water! It smells great but not overpowering. Very fresh. I have a toddler and it has already saved two outfits I though were goners. Once it was a white shirt covered in acrylic paint. Tide didn't touch the paint. Ran it through on cold with Persil - perfect! Next, the time that really sealed the deal, a shirt was covered in oil - and I do mean covered. One wash with Persil, the stain was completely gone. wow I never would admit paying such a high price for  laundry would make that much a difference the dingy whites come out so bright I need sunglasses.  LOL I gotta say these Persil ProClean Power-Caps are great. I prefer them over the Tide ones. I like the scent, it's not overpowering. For me it could be a little more, but that's why we got scent boosters now for those who love a stronger smell. Cleaned my laundry, didn't have problems with it not dissolving. I have already bought the two pack twice and will definitely buy it a third time. Would recommend. This stuff is absolutely amazing.  You will not believe how it will whiten and brighten your clothing.  If this sounds like something out of  a TV commercial, then you should know I am (a) male, and (b) like most guys, I am not into what my laundry looks like as long as it comes out of the washing machine clean.  Try it, you will be impressed, and you WILL notice the difference. I bought this after reading numerous suggestions from a cleaning page on FB. I bought this for my boyfriend's clothes, as he's a mechanic & comes home covered in grease. These have worked better than any other ""laundry pack"" I've bought. I also use these to strip & sanitize my laundry on occasion. I make my own cleaners & detergents & add enzymes so my clothes get clean. If you're someone who does this also or someone who doesn't use commercial cleaners, be prepared for this product to take your breath away. It does it every time I open the box. Also, it comes with a ""perfume card"" you will smell this all throughout your home. I grew up in the UK where we've had Persil for years.  My mum has used Persil for as long as I can remember so I was pleased the brand has FINALLY made it over here.  I love the pod laundry detergent: just easier to measure and you know you're getting exactly x number of loads. I love the smell and the cleaning power. I only throw one packet in with a large load of laundry unless it is exceptionally soiled or very large, like my comforter. I used to routinely use two. I am very impressed with all of the Persil products I have used. I just wish they were a little cheaper! I have ordered twice now and haven’t had a problem with them arriving damaged. I love the original Persil liquid but use the pods for convenience. Persil has a strong smell which is what I prefer in a detergent. It works especially well for cleaning workout clothes. I haven’t had a problem with these pods not completely dissolving like I have previously had with Kirkland and Gain pods. One warning I have is that sometimes the pods can get tangled inside the fitted sheet of bed sheets and it won’t fully dissolve :(",1,1
"Amazing set of pans. My wife loves them. I did A LOT of research on pots/pans before I chose Cristel. I have very limited storage space in our motorhome and wanted a small footprint and with the detachable handles, these really do stack within themselves nicely. The lids are also very easy to store even though they are glass because they are flat and don't have the knobs on the top. The whole set literally takes up 1/4 the space my old set took. These also work on electric, gas and induction stove tops which is what I needed for being ""on the road"". I have owned this cookware for about 15 years.  It's still like new.  I particularly like the removable handle.  Less room to store, and any piece (except non stick) can go in the oven.  I've also had the same handle and it's never once malfunctioned.  I can't say enough nice things about it.  I would order the non stick skillets, but according to Cook's Magazine, it really is foolish to spend a lot of money on non stick as it ALL wears out.",1,1
"I thought this would be the same Biolage body shampoo I had before.  This product leaves hair like straw and requires a conditioner after every use.  There is a delicate balance between adding body and Preventing breakage. Bodifying shampoos tend to dry out hair. Conditioners weigh hair down. Even bodyfying conditioners. My scalp can't handle conditioners everyday either. Wish I could find my old Biolage. The same product I get in the beauty store, only much cheaper. This is a great shampoo for thin hair. My all time favorite. Excellent product! Great shampoo for fine hair!!! I have fine hair (but a lot of it) so my hair is easily weighed down by products. I've only used this a couple of times but I can tell a huge difference in my hair. Even after sleeping, my second hair still looks great and has volume. LOVE this shampoo! Been a Biolage customer for years, but this product was very thin and soupy...are you kidding me...this is not the same as the last Biolage product...very disappointed Great, high quality shampoo. I have super fine hair.  This doesn't weigh down my hair.  It's looks great all day",1,1

"This watch is essential for ACT students, especially if you have extended time. The presets for extended time give you a break down of all of the given time for your test. As soon as I started practicing and mastering my pacing with the watch my scores went up. The G1 watch does not have features for extended time, so if you have it then definitely go with the G2 watch. I got this for my daughter who's taking the ACT test soon. It helps her keep pace and lessens anxiety over the test. It's easy to use and we let her practice turning it on a few times. It also has a time screen when not used for testing. It has more of a boyish design and I don't think my daughter would use it except for the test, but she'll be taking quite a few tests until college with this. Worth every penny!  I called ACT directly to find out if the watch was allowed during testing because there were some mixed comments on this site.  ACT said as long as the device does not make any noise it would be fine.  The watch and timer make absolutely no noise.  Using it helped pace my son which helped secure the score he was looking for. The new G2 watch is a major upgrade from the G1 watch. The updated writing is very helpful and the custom timer is a major feature. Not only have I been increasing my ACT score, but now I have the ability to use the watch for my other exams too (AP exams and SAT Subject tests). Great product and highly recommended! My daughter said this watch was extremely helpful in determining if she was adequately pacing herself while taking the ACT.  The watch makes no sound  and she liked the dashed border showing where she was in the section of the test she was taking.  The only drawback was that the G2 did not come with instructions for setting the current time, etc.  We were able to download the directions so it was not a problem. The test center did not allow this watch - despite printing the paperwork recommended by Testing Timers This is awesome for helping keep track of time during the act. An indispensable tool. No problem using during the actual exam. My fourth child just took the ACT using the Testing Timers watch. The watch is simple to use and perfect for test taking. Rather than worry about clocks and times, you simply start the pre-set timer for each section. It is a perfect way to pace yourself while taking practice tests and then seamlessly pace yourself during the actual test.",1,1

"XOXO #XO3400: It just arrived 1 1/2 hours ago from Amazon & I'm very pleased.''  Looks even better than the picture! The rose-gold metal is really pretty & the leather-look gray strap harmonizes nicely with it.' this is perfect for small wrists. the band is a little thinner than normal though. nice watch for price. OK, I'm a big XOXO fan, I'll admit that.  But it doesn't mean I love them all.  This one is very, very lovely.  It's quite different than their usual watch, it's small and demure.  The band feels like a soft brushed leather.  The face is easy to read, clear without the usual decorative look of XOXO.  I was surprised to find myself drawn to it actually.  But there is a delicate quietness and grace about this casual/dressy little watch that somehow I just knew had a place in my watch box.  Oh yes, on my wrist too! This watch is very attractive and fits my slim wrists very well. It's classy, well made, and easy to read. I initially bought it to wear to work but it HAS gotten pretty beaten up on the job. It still functions perfectly even though it's gotten wet and bashed up on numerous occasions, so the rough treatment has only affected it cosmetically. I will probably order another eventually to wear outside of work because it fits so well and goes with so many outfits. I wanted something thinner than the 45mm massive watch faces out now.  This is definitely dainty, very thin straps.  The problem is the watch face has metal loops on the top and bottom, and the loops are wrapped and riveted down to a base piece of pleather.  When you wear it, the base pleather wraps around your wrist, but the watch face is raised about a quarter inch.  Just hovering with space between it and the base pleather.  Too awkward. I have been wearing this watch about 3 days a week for about three months now for both casual and dressy occasions. I absolutely love it! Have recieved many compliments and it has kept perfect time. Absolutely love the watch I have very tiny wrist so it is very hard and need to find a watch that fits this is perfect I have never owned a grey wash before and it goes with everything so if you are like me and  you are small boned get this watch if you are larger it will not fit you. The band is not sized properly for the watch, so the watch will not fit flat on the band on the wrist. Instead it hovers quite a way above and is prone to catch on sleeves or anything else that comes near. It caught on something within a month of purchasing and the little pin that holds it popped out, so now it's trash.",1,1
"My husband loves this shirt! Looks good on him too, nice fit! He usually wears a xl or 2x, I ordered the 2x and it fits nice with aliilte room to spare. This is for my son-in-law for Christmas. From the appearance of the product I think he will like it very much. Plus I was quick on getting our order. very soft and comfortable Fits great. Size runs as stated. Nice shirt. gift i loved the shirt but way to small, had other things going on at time, never tryed to return it.. i cant say nothing but just wish i'd had time to ask for bigger size.. print and fabric was nice... Classy shirt. It is a Christmas gift but I  can tell from the look and feel of the shirt that my husband will love it! It was a gift for my dad from my mom. He really liked it and started wearing it recently.",1,1
Cover is thicker than I expected but it's great. The bottom doesn't cover the entire base of the laptop though. Insides came a little scratched (tried to clean it that's how I found out).   Overall it's a good product.,1,1

"You can't go wrong for the price, but the pocket squares are not large enough to use without a pocket holder. I suggest if you are going to buy these ties with pocket squares, get yourself a square holder like the Best Pocket Square Holder. Good quality! The quality was much higher than expected.  Great deal! The quality of the products are good but I only received 8 of the 9 items.  I did not receive 1 set of cuff links. I am very pleased with the quality of this order. No problems at this time This was a steal of a deal and the quality was awesome for the price I will be BACK FOR MORE Great ties at a good price",1,1
"Great deal for a bag like this - the outside is a little bulky, but it should protect my tablet well.  I used it for my Surface Pro 3 and it fits in the main padded compartment along with the keyboard with plenty of room the spare.  The accessory side hold all the extra gear including charger pack and cable, video-out cable, stylus, ear buds, reading glasses, etc. with plenty of extra room. This is AWESOME!! I love being able to carry my MacBook Pro, iPad, and all accessories in ONE case without having everything bunched at the bottom!! It would be better with a shoulder strap option, but since I usually carry it in my backpack, it doesn't really matter.  Good quality and delivered quickly. I wanted to buy local, but couldn't find anything like it at my local Best Buy or Staples. In fact, their salespeople loved it when I showed them this option I was looking for on my phone. This is a nice case and the quality looks decent. The only thing is that is it’s bigger than expected so it looks like it can hold a 15 inch and I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro which is the size this is listed for. Overall I like all the compartments because I keeps other stuff separate from the laptop itself so that great. Would recommend. I haven't dropped the laptop from any great heights, but it's doing a fine job of protecting from everyday bumps and what not.  It also did well at keeping everything dry in a pretty good rainstorm.  In hindsight I wish it had a shoulder strap, but it really isn't a big deal.  I'd have no problems buying another one of these if I had a second laptop. Lots of room, fits my dell laptop and I like the soft sleeve to hold it in being separated from the cords and additional equipment help in the other zippered pocket. I've used it daily for over a month and am very pleased with my purchase For the price a well made unit - i am storing secured 6 portable hard-drives instead of an laptop very good compromise Perfect for carrying a MacAir when you don't want the whole backpack. Great idea to have pockets for the accessories, and the case has good cushion to protect the computer.",1,1

"This thing works great. Motion sensor works great and always immediately starts filming. I’m also able to easily download everything and save it. I’d highly recommend this product, it works great and is a great deal. I ordered a cheaper one before but I had a lot of trouble getting the video off. I wouldn’t wast your time woth any other product than this one lots of the reviews are clearly by ""professional reviewers"" - you only have to click on them and see they give every product 5 stars, likely without ever seeing the products. Hopefully Amazon will fix this one day. It totally looks like a wall charger, you could even charge your phone with it! But the main function of it is a wireless camera, and a pretty good one consider its size and the very small lens. The functions are similar with general wireless cameras, like remote watch, microSD card recording, alarm alertm etc. Everything a normal wireless camera could do, this one could do as well, maybe better because it is also 1080P. The only downside, is that this particularly one has no night vision, I think it is because of its lens size is too small, or because it needs to stay hidden. Anyway, I am using it as a backup camera in case someone destroy my main camera system. I took a very short video using this camera here, I think with this kind of video, the camera could be good for security, or monitor purpose. This camera has a great quality camera which is just enough for those who doesn’t do professional shoots just home video. For this price I can say good deal Excellent product! Exactly what I needed. The camera is very well hidden and nearly unnoticeable. You will see it only if you look very close. I’m very satisfied with the quality of the video as well. It comes with a cable which makes it easy to transfer it to your computer. I’m using it for my personal purpose. So far very successful! Definitely recommend to others. This tiny spy camera is perfect. It is easy to install and set up. The feature of motion detection works well. This hidden spy camera is awesome. If you don’t know that it is camera, you will never understand that. We bought it for traveling to keep an eye on our hotel room. It really works! Worked OK when testing except assigning wrong date to video files.  Date in WPSettings.dat file matched  today's date (2-24-18) but the video files were assigned the date 1-22- 2017.  Have not found a way to correct this.  If your videos are displayed upside down you have inserted the charger/camera  upside down.  To correct this problem move the files to Windows Movie Maker  and look for the Rotate Right/Left  tool.  Further, it records video files in*.AVI format (outdated format) .  When opening the video app, click on OPEN WITH ....... and select a different video app in case your's doesn't work (Windows Media player works fine).",1,1

"I wanted a boot for my son that wasnt going to cost me a ton, since his feet grow so fast, but would be warm and keep his feet dry. We live in Michigan, and after getting 12 inches of snow this past week, these boots have stood the test! I ordered them a size bigger than his shoes so that he would have some wiggle room for warm, and they are perfect. He does not need extra socks, and they stay dry inside. These boots worked great, warm, cozy, fit just right for my very active 6 year old son in our very snowy long winter area . However after less than 2 months of use, one boot fell apart at the seam at the heel and and the other in front at the seam. My 'return window' closed so really there's nothing I can do but buy yet another set of boots. Others have mentioned snow sticking to the soles so I've added a picture because it's so unusual that it's hard to imagine. These compressed snow balls develop in a couple of minutes and the kid starts asking for a hand just to help with walking. Warm and sturdy. The main problem is that they've been useless in the snow -- the snow just clumps up on the bottom and then creates a snow block on the bottom of the boot that my son can't walk on. Four different snows (admittedly wet snows) and it has happened each time. My guess is that the tread is too deep and when the snow packs into the tread the sole is too stiff for a toddler to flex while walking so the snow doesn't break off 'naturally' --- it just builds and builds until there's a snow block.  I'm now searching for boots with more shallow tread or a more flexible sole. My daughter loves her boots.  They keep her feet warm, dry and she loves how comfortable they are.  They are holding up great for this winter season which is great as my six year old loves the snow and if she is not in it at home she is at school.  They also wash up beautifully when any dirt gets stuck on them.  I am very happy with these boots and I did buy it a size up, my daughter is size 1 in shoes so I always go a size up for boots and she has a bit of room still to grow in them. I said somewhat small because the area where the fabric meets the rubber boot part was very tight.  It was hard to get on and off of him.  Length is perfect, so correct size but you can't avoid that area when putting on.  My grandson doesn't have fat feet , very normal, but it was hard to get these on him and had he not needed to wear them in the snow, he would have taken them off.  However once his foot made it past that part, they were comfortable. Great boots, look nice, and good quality. After reading many reviews, I went with these and am happy. Definitely buy a size up; they run a bit small, they are winterer boots which requires thicker socks, and you want to use them for more than one season! They are good enough in quality that we will get 2 seasons and pass down to our nephew for 2 seasons. With the price and will but this brand again next time around. Good quality boots; wasn't sure with ordering online even with reading reviews. My son wears a 3.5 shoe currently and based on reviews, we ordered up (size 5), however his toes were right at the end of the boot! Exchanging for a size 6, which is crazy considering he wears more than 2 sizes smaller than this. Hopefully the size 6 fits better!",1,1
"This is by far the best camera bag that I have found.  I bought my husband a Nikon D3300 for Christmas and searched for other bags.  Similar bags by other brands were cheaply made and I'm so glad that we went with this Nikon product.  It's the perfect size and excellent quality. Camera bag is as described. I can fit my D810 with a 24-120 lens attached along with another lens and flash in the bag. In addition I can fit many accessories in the bag. The only downside for this bag is it is not sealed, there are openings on the side. Therefore, living in FL I lways have a large plastic bag in the bag as well in case of a downpour, however, I new this before purchasing it. It suits my needs well and I have another bag if I have a longer lens on the camera. But truthfully this is the one I use the most as an everyday bag. Yes I'm happy with it for the price, it's made well. I had an earlier Nikon bag that lost one of the front latches so I needed a replacement. This one is nice but is slightly smaller even though it had the same model number in my search. It makes putting the camera in its case a bit more of a challenge than the last one. I like the bag, but just a bit more room would have been nice. The one I bought was a refurbished from a third-party seller but it looked brand new and was a great price! This camera bag works great with our Nikon D5300 dual lens kit - it's large enough to fit the camera, manuals, and both lens (leaving one attached to the camera). Great bag, I carry a D300 with a small to medium size lens and an additional lens to side.  I also lay a flash speedlight in its sleeve above the camera.  Front pocket holds a manual, extra plugs while the inside overhead pouch holds my USB cable and additional lens covers.  Top zipper is for receipts and the side pockets can each carry an extra battery and/or further AA batteries for my flash. The bag itself is nice - sturdy and has nice compartments.  But it barely holds my D750 camera body and one lens.  There is no way I can fit another lens and/or flash inside this bag.  Will be returning it and finding something larger Excellent bag for a single DSLR with a few accessories.  Just the right size.  Not too bulky Great bag, really good protection! Lots of room for accessories. I use it with my Nikon while chasing trains. Tossed in and out of the car, kept my camera safe.",1,1

"The purse is cute but it’s Smaller than they stated. It states it’s 14” long....it’s not. It’s atually 12 1/2 inches long. I was hoping it was bigger, I was hoping for a 14” Bag. Purchased as a gift and love the color and design. I would like to recommend the clutch bag. So pretty! Perfect for a formal wedding I'm going to! I was worried that it would be an impractical size however, it is perfect to hold all the necessities for a long night out. Also, the price makes it a perfect selection! The best thing is that you can use it for a fancy and even a casual occasion depending on what you're wearing.",1,1

"We have been wanting a WiFi security camera for our house for a while now.  The original intent was to place the camera outside to monitor the grounds and front door but we ended up getting a peephole camera to take care of that so we deployed this camera inside for a few days.  There is a video attached showing some of the footage we captured, including one of our cats chasing a drone, an overnight cat play session and...yes...we seem to have captured a ghost.  The camera records in 720p and the video is accessible either in real-time or from DVR playback via the cell phone app.  The camera is always recording but the motion sensors flag periods where there is action so you can quickly scan through hours and hours of boring video to find the highlights.

"EDIT: When I bought these boots they were advertised/titled as hiking boots. Looks like they changed the title to combat boots. 2-Week Review: I love these shoes. I've worn them every day since I bought them, and I am pleased to report no issues yet, whatsoever. They're pretty warm (I wear them in Illinois and it is currently February) for short periods (my experience is only about a half hour at a time) with wool socks. They scuff a little easily but I don't mind the slightly rugged look, so it doesn't bother me. It might bother someone else though, so be mindful. I have the brown pair of these too and left a review on those as well but just got the black ones and I use them for both automotive shop work and as a server and they're perfect. My brown one's held up for a year and they're still in wearable condition and have held up for over a year. They do take a few days to break in like any shoe but if you're looking for a good work boot (mind you these aren't steel toed) but very functional. I'm gonna keep buying these because I like them so much. I have been looking for a good work boot. I was skeptical about buying online without being able to try them on. But I went ahead and took the chance. They arrived on time and packaged well. I was worried how comfortable my feet would be since I have what my husband calls baby feet. Let me tell you I wear them everyday to work on a construction site and not once have they made my feet hurt. I was also worried about them falling apart easily since they are very inexpensive. Well, they have held up pretty well! The tops have scratched up some but that was expected. I'm very pleased with this purchase and will by buying from this company again. Also I wear a size 81/2 sometimes a 9 depending on the brand. So I ordered a 81/2 and they fit perfect! I'll be starting my (current) dream job in plant nursery so I wanted some good outdoor working boots that could handle what I wanted from them. When I first put these boots on I was really surprised how limber they are right out of the box! The only thing I see needing some time to get used to is where the shoes rest on your ankle. The material is nice, but some people don't like the fact that they do tend to get scuffed up really easy whenever you run into something hard. I actually did this not 2 minutes after I put them on, all I did was use my thumb to rub away the scuff mark, and it was gone. I've gotten these shoes twice so far because I LOVE them. They are comfortable, they stay relatively warm and dry in the winter (especially after applying some weatherproof spray).  I wore them for a whole year, and they only got ruined after working at an aquarium for months and getting them soaked with water and cleaning chemicals.  I'm so happy Amazon saves past orders so I can go back and find these beauties every time I need a new pair. Very good quality and beautifull boots considering the price",1,1

"This is a good Jurassic World shirt. I bought this one because of the color scheme; light blue and gray work well together. The graphic on the shirt was tilted and stretched. This happens when the shirt is place on the printing plate stretched. I returned the first one and the second one came just as bad. I think I will return the second one as well. Don't waste your time and money, folks. Otherwise the shirt fits fine but who would wear a shirt that looks like you bought it from a night market in a third world country? The large is a very wide cut large. The shirt itself is thin and when it first arrived, it was very stiff. I ordered this shirt for my sons JW themed B-day party, so it's basically a one time wear for me. Although it's quality is good and the print seems perfectly centered and symmetrical (I read some reviews that suggested otherwise), it is a bit large for me. This isn't necessarily the fault of the manufacturer, so if you're like me and are usually between a medium and a large depending on the shirt, definitely go with the medium opposed to trying to shrink the large. Shirt is a little thinner than I expect.  While it's not really see through while wearing it, it you hold it up to the sun or wear a white tank underneath you can see through it.  Also the colors are much more bland.  The bright blue around the Dino skeleton is actually just a tad lighter than the shirt.  It's not bright like pictured at all. Bought for our daughters birthday.. it was a thin material... but fit to size. Good shirt for the price. Love it, it's light weight for our Texas weather and fits just right! I'm 6'4"" 200lbs and all arms and legs so I am reviewing the 2XL.  Print is great, not that thick graphic print and the shirt material is soft.  Length and neck hole are a good size for the skinny guy.",1,1
"The shirt is medium weight cotton of reasonable quality.  I bought two shirts: XL and 2XL.  The XL (my normal size) would clearly be too small with any shrinkage after washing while the 2XL is somewhat large.  Of course, 'loose fit' works for a T-shirt, so not a problem.  The 3D effect on the shirt itself is a little different from the image shown on Amazon; but still striking.  If you want a dog themed shirt with something more than the outline of a dog and a stupid caption, this product will certainly do that for you. I ordered this in 3xl expecting it to shrink (and my guy is a big fellow). it didn't so I ordered a second one in 2 xl that fits him perfectly ad I have a nice night shirt. Love it. As described. The sales image is beautiful.  The image on the sales image is fuller (might be regular large size) than on the image of the XL size and XL shirt image just doesn't look the the same. :( Now n memory of my 14 year old boy that i recently lost. nice Fit good.  Quality good.  3D image is more noticeable when you take a photo of it than when you wear it.  Good price and delivery. Nice shirt.",1,1
"awesome, thanks",1,-1
Very good!  101% worth the price :),1,1
"They fit fine but otherwise feel like cheap junk. They are very thin, not soft at all, and the collar is not always down flat as advertised. I used to buy fruit of the loom shirts and underwear exclusively but have tried some other brands since. I came back to fruit of the loom when the others didn't last. Unfortunately this isn't like what I used to get. I will not be buying these again. Husband is quite happy with these undershirts. He previously only wore Roundtree & Yorke, but their shirts became so thin, they were full of holes within a year. These Fruit of the Loom shirts feel thick and heavy, and I don’t believe they’ll be falling apart in the next 12 months. nice colors.  the shirts fit until after the second washing when they shrank beyond wearing.  they will fit a L or a M very well now. I've always bought Hanes and was leery of FOTL. But no! These are softer and they are longer. No more creeping up during the day. I will stick with FOTL from now on. Great price. Last a while. Nothing beats the feeling of a fresh T. These fit as expected. They do not rise as advertised. Great fit at a fantastic price. Fit as expected... Longer than they used to be",1,1
Item received in order and its cheaper than retail. Good buy!,1,-1
"Low rating due to one of two glasses having a weird ring defect.  This is new from box. One glass is perfect the other has this deep ring along the base outside. Have to attribute to a manufacturing defect As others mention, a perfect size for a traditional martini, manhattan, or similar cocktail with a shot-and-a-half of liquid. Anything more and you'll overflow this glass. So many of Riedel's wine glasses do next to nothing for the liquids they hold that it is easy to fall into the generalization that the entire Reidel line is more for cachet than the appreciation of superior beverages. We have many types of Riedel glasses, most of which offer more sizzle than steak. However, there are two major exceptions: Sauternes wine glasses, and whiskey glasses. Both are expensive and worth every dime, plus the ""single malt whiskey"" glass does nicely not only with whiskey (and whisky), but also leading-edge premium rums. These are the best glasses for single malt scotch! The difference between these and the glencairn is nothing short of astounding. If you're spending the money on a good bottle, you have to drink from these glasses.  My friends thought I was crazy until we did a tasting in my kitchen years ago.  This is the second set of theses I have bought.  I have a half a dozen glencairn for company, but I only drink from these. These make cognac so much more enjoyable! The size is perfect. The glass fits nicely in my hand. And the shape concentrates the aroma so that each time I take a sip, my nose is filled with the wonderful smell of the cognac. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys cognac and wants to enhance their drinking experience. Have had these for years and broke enough over 20 years (my fault) to look for the same ones again.  These are my everyday glasses as well as the water goblets for dinner parties.  Will continue to buy as replacements for as long as possible. These really are wonderful. I discovered them when a waiter at Gary Danko brought me a taster of Hendricks Gin in one a few years back. I immediately set out in search of the glass.  Obviously, these are for drinking neat rather than on the rocks. (I tend to add a half of a small ice cube - chills it a wee bit - allows that extra bit of aroma to mingle with the liquid - works for me.) I was debating between these and the tulip shaped Riedel cognac glasses. I settled on these thinking that these are for more general uses. The package arrived on time double boxed.",1,1
"Good shirt at a great price. Watch the size, though. I can usually wear a medium t-shirt, but this seems to run a bit smaller. I can still use it, wearing it as an undershirt shirt, but it is too snug to wear alone. I don't want the ladies swooning from the sight of the rippling muscles beneath. I ordered this shirt for my husband mainly because I was looking for a navy blue t-shirt to match mine. He's kind of picky when it comes to t-shirts. He looks for neck style, he hates thick shirts and graphic tees that touch his skin from the inside. This one seemed perfect (to me at least) and it was so inexpensive that I went for it. BEST DECISION EVER! He loved it so much he's ordered one in every color. We live in Texas and he's an HVAC Tech, so he has to wear breathable clothing to be able to function. He wears them for everything now! Work, at home, errands, out and about.... literally everywhere! They're comfy and nice enough to wear them out. I wash them in cold water and hang to air dry. They haven't faded or shrunk. Perfect for summer and under sweaters for winter. True to size, totally recommend! I purchased one of these t-shirts on a road trip at CVS months ago -- ended up really liking how the shirt felt and fit so I ordered more on Amazon. I ordered 5shirts, only 3pcs received the first time. After emailing seller I received 2more. The items received are not exactly the same as on the picture. Garment construction is odd, shoulders are too narrow. One shirts had a damaged fabric, vertical line running througout the shirt, while 2shirts have white horizontal lines. You will notice more that the construction is odd when you fold the shirts, all my other Gildan shirts feels and folds like every other ""normal"" shirts. I ordered one shirt to ck it out. Nice shirt so ordered 3 more and then noticed the first shirt has a tiny hole on the side. Just a 6 buck shirt but notified the seller. Got right back to me for order number . But a few days later nada. The may still be processing or deciding what to do but no big deal. The shirt is very very thin. Walmart has the starter brand for 4.50 approx that is a bit thicker and I have had 3 of them for 10 years and have worn the hell out of them. i got these for my husband and he really liked them. They are lighter weight because they are polyester. But they feel nice and look nice. You can tell they have the wicking ability which is good because we live in Florida...and it is always hot. I love these t-shirts and bought them in a variety of colors.  I am female, but I like that the sleeves have good coverage and the length is perfect.  Long enough to cover some bumps while not clinging to the skin.  If I were a male purchasing this product however I would say they are not true to size.  I wear a men's XL as sleep shirts usually and this XL would not qualify for that type of use due to the slim fit. My son likes this shirt a lot but it does run a bit big. I would have ordered him a size smaller but h e says he will keep it. The material is very nice to the touch so guys your girlfriends will love this shirt! The coloring is good and held up well in the wash. It's a very hip shade of pink. I would recommend",1,1
"Loved this belt! It was affordable, durable and went great with my dress. I received tons of compliments!!! Beautiful, but very heavy. I wish the ribbon was not visible around the actual beading... This makes the ribbon very wide and almost combersome. I have a petite waist, and with the thick ribbon and added weight, do not think this will work :( I ordered the belt for my granddaughter who will be a junior maid of honor at her mom's wedding in June.  The belt was beautiful and exactly as the picture shows.  I ordered it in ivory. I was a little hesitant to order this color at first because one of the reviews said it was more yellowy.  But I feel it's ivory and perfect. At the end of the satin ribbon are little rhinestones, which look beautiful. My granddaughter is a size 16 and there was plenty of room to tie it.  It came packaged very nicely in a box.  It arrived very quickly, I believe it was within a week.  I was very satisfied with everything, however, one of the rhinestones had come off and was loose in the box.  Upon looking at it, it looked like the last rhinestone wasn't properly ended with the last stitch, hence the 4 star rating.  This was an easy fix. I hot glued it on in it's place, and problem solved.  It is very beautiful, beautiful boxed and shipped.  I would highly recommend this belt! I am glad that I purchased this. It looked very nice with my coral bridesmaid dress. I loved it and compared to the one my sister n law purchased for $40 - $50 they were both the same but I paid less money. You will not go wrong with this purchase. The belt I received was well-made, sturdy, and stunning. Do not waste your money purchasing a belt elsewhere. This was an awesome buy. This is  absolutely gorgeous! Very happy first one I ordered didn't match the dress they exchanged it easy enough was very happy with product very pretty Beautiful, better than expected.",1,1
"This is a very fast pc. It boots up very fast. The video card can let you play any game out there right now. I use it to play Playersunknown Battlegrounds. It does the job just fine. The only issue is that the PC runs very hot when playing the games. The 4 fans are pretty basic. I ended up buying one of those powerful Noctua($25) fans to blow air back out and it brought down my CPU  temps  from 73c to 35c while playing. My video card would run at around 83c and with the fan it only gets to 65c when playing. It used to be warm to the touch, but now runs fine. Highly recommend purchasing a Noctua fan. To blow the hot air out. Other then that. This thing works great with room to improve. I spent a long time trying to balance price vs performance for my Samsung Mixed Reality headset (which, by the way is awesome). I shopped around for a self build too. I could not get a better price point than this PC. It does the job really well except that the machine does not have Bluetooth and thus can't connect the controllers - I had to buy a Bluetooth dongle. I have been using this computer for a little over a week now,and am VERY happy with it. Been so busy transferring files over from my old computer and doing other things that I haven't played any games with it yet,but it's smoking fast. I honestly can't believe I bought a computer this fast for this kind of money. This PC is a great deal when it comes to needing a complete setup. It is rare to find a pre-built setup for such value. (Piecing the parts and building yourself costs the same or more) It runs Rising Storm Vietnam in 4k at 60fps which is really impressive. PUBG is a bit more intensive but runs perfectly at 2K at 80fps. The PC fans are very quiet however the WD hard drive can be heard but is not excessively loud. The cable management is also very neat however i would like to see zip ties used instead of twist ties. The only problems that i have run into so far are that the cooling could be improved, playing for long periods at ultra settings have increased the GPU to the higher end of specification. About 89 degrees C peak at times. I have yet to toy around with AMD Chill or Fan settings and have left everything in automatic mode but this minor problem may be remedied in these settings. The CPU cooler is also a bit small but it gets the job done. I wish the keyboard emblem lights would turn off when the PC is sleeping like the mouse does because they are rather bright. Hey The CyberpowerPC GXiVR8020A4OPT Gamer Xtreme VR is a great gaming pc.  The new pc booted up without issue when first turned on after connecting the peripherals including keyboard, mouse and monitor.  The included USB WiFi device installed itself as soon as it was inserted into the USB port and I was able to connect the house's network.  I can not say enough good things about this pc especially for the price.",1,1
"These are very soft and comfortable while being sexy. I have a 32in waist and  ordered the US M=Tag CN XL(31""-33"") and they fit snug yet comfortable.It almost feels like you are wearing nothing! These are very comfortable.  Great colors, nice fit.  Good sizing instructions These are very comfortable, and fit perfect, but you have to pay attention to the size. I normally wear Medium, but these are 2XL. Always order the US size and not the Oriental size. I have a 30 inch waist and I purchased a large Asian size. And they fit perfectly.  I wear them for a morning run or to the gym and do short’s of coarse. Wonderful minimal bikini, folds into small size, great for travel.  Dries fast. Almost translucent, so if you don't mind showing more of your junk, it's fine. the fabic is very light and pleasantly smooth but the pouch is not much and worn right-side out the leg-hole seams chaff my scrotum; these are better worn inside-out. they are so narrow that the back actually slides down, especially sitting. The sizing is probably correct; when I marked too small, I refer to the extreme nature of their low-rise design. Great price and nice fit Comfortable",1,1
"Pretty disappointed.  When I got this shirt I loved it. After only one washing in cold water and being hung up to dry, part of the punsiher symbol already came off. I posted a picture. I would return/exchange it but it's just more of a hassle. Got a Medium, which is usually a bit too big.  This one was almost too small.  The fabric is very rough and scratchy.  I chose this one because others said it was soft.  Gave it a shot and washed it hoping it would soften up.  I think it's even worse now.  Pretty much hating it and stuck with it. Nice Shirt but ran a little small so it fits tight around the chest. Just what I was looking for. Well made and fit just right. Washed it a couple times already and the printing has held up perfectly and the material is super soft. Love it! This shirt is awesome! Ive been wanting one for a while but I was looking for a good price and a particular style. I was going to get one from Walmart but those have weird stripes on the sleeves and I just wanted a classic punisher shirt and this one is it. Good shirt, surprisingly the shirt quality is not cheap as I expected it to be. The decal has not faded or deteriorated and it's been worn & washed many times. A bit smaller than my usual M and a bit wider for that smaller size. But it will do for a few outs, not too much of a difference to return it :) I really like the T-shirt. The sizing was perfect and as far as material and durability the shirt is good. It's also exactly as advertised and you won't be disappointed.",1,1
"I was curious about how this belt would reverse with that buckle. Now I get my belt on my hand and I have to say great for the idea of this belt. The belt is well made for the two sides so both side can be wear outside. But I have to unscrew the wrapped leather which catch the buckle and the belt to release the belt apart from the buckle. And I use the brown loops when I use brown side outside. It is worth more than 20 dollars. I will update if there is any problem of the belt. So far so good. Nice belt, one side black and the other brown. Unlike rotate buckle reversible belt, you need screwdriver to undone the buckle from the belt and reverse the belt and then fasten it. Fortunately, the screwdriver is sent together with the belt and an instruction includded too. New idea about the pin buckle belt. Worth the price. Good quality, size is exact, the belt seems to last for a long time, buckle is decent. Nice package. I will order another one for my father.  This is a really nice belt, reversible. I have wear it for a while and no allergy, so nickle free, but we will update if anything happening in the future, so far so good. This is NOT Nickle free.",1,1
"I'm a big fan of flavored coffees, and this four-pack of flavors has been a big hit with me. It's obvious from the reviews that not all tastes are equally satisfied. Hard to predict what will be a hit with any given individual, but, for me, I've found these flavors comparable in strength to most flavored coffees I drink. They have a lightly sweet flavor, which I enjoy - the chocolate marshmallow swirl is one of my favorite flavored coffees ever, despite the fact that I usually don't care for chocolate coffees. PACKAGING: All flavors came jumbled in a box, which was expected. However, because they were obviously repackaged by someone, the cups themselves were dirty. I have to clean off every single one of them before I can put them in the Keurig. My morning caffeine fix has to be hot and unflavored and my k9 workout buddies have agreed that the morning patrol begins after I get at least 2 sips.  But I have been looking for a more flavored coffee for the workout cool down 2nd cup.  If you like butterscotch, this is the kcup for you, plus it's under the Friendly's logo.  Hmmm Friendly's, I wish one was less than 500 miles away, but the kcup helps... I saw some blogs giving away different types of flavors (not this flavor) and when I came to Amazon, this one popped up that others were buying as well.  Sounded so yummy - I love peanut butter with a passion.  I am on a strict diet so I can't have peanut butter or ice cream for that matter so I tend to use coffee as my 'treat' so to speak (as long as there are no carbs).  There are no carbs in these kcups - confirmed by the Seller.  I'm not going to lie - I expected this to be like eating a jar of peanut butter but they were not.  It is very lightly flavored - almost nutty and the coffee is very smooth.  So overall, pretty good but wish the flavor was more intense. First - I'm a fan of light to medium roast flavored coffees. I've especially become fond of Peppermint flavored coffee. If you prefer darker blends with that slight bitter coffee bite - this coffee is not for you. I am a coffee addict, especially flavored coffee. And I love ice cream. Who knew they blended the two together?! I was super excited to find these K-Cups, however I have to say, out of the four flavors included, I really only like the Vienna Mocha Chunk and Chocolate Marshmallow Swirl. I was really hoping the Mint Chocolate Chip would have been more minty, however it was disappointingly weak in flavor. The Butterscotch is also very meh. I would order again, but would only order individual flavors rather than this variety pack. I hate to complain because I have ordered this product multiple times and have been completely satisfied each time.  The price is right and I really do love this product, the flavor is to my liking and the blend of coffee is a nice smooth blend. This coffee is smooth & leaves no aftertaste. There is a nice peppermint flavor. It’s less expensive than other peppermint kcups I have purchased. I was a bit worried because of mixed reviews. However, I have no regrets of buying. I love this coffee! 100% premium Arabica coffee beans infused with the flavor of limited edition peppermint stick ice cream.",1,1

"I have another Canon, the PowerShot A630 that I really like. It's was bigger to just put in my pocket so I wanted to go smaller. I'm very happy with ELPH 180, a newer ELPH 170. I've used it to take stills as well as video and quite impressed with both. The pictures are very clean and clear. I'm also impressed with the battery life even when using the video. I know I'll be very happy with this, not only because it's a Canon but also because it's small. I'd definitely recommend this to others. The camera and the accessories arrived as expected, and after charging the battery (must be taken out of the camera and placed in the charger) I tried to take some pictures in different light situations and different distances. The quality of the pictures are acceptable but not outstanding. I had expected more sharpness from a 20 MP camera, and less noise in the low light pictures. However, this is a low price camera, and is great for snap shots. The small size makes it easy to carry around, and the 32GB memory card can hold several thousand pictures. The memory card must be taken out of the camera and placed in either the USB cradle that is part of the deal or a designated port on your computer. Bought this as an upgrade to an older Canon we have.  Works well just like the hold one.  My only complaint is a takes a long time inbetween photos to be able to take another.  So when holding a pose it takes forever to take multiple pics. Just picked it up yesterday and so far it looks great.  It was delivered within the specified timing.  I'm going on vacation and I'm tired of relying on my phone for pictures and video.  I also needed something small and easy to carry.  My sister's a photographer and recommended this one.  I think it is a great bundle, it has everything you need.  We tested it yesterday and pictures look great! We went on a trip out of the country and left our 35 mm with telephoto lens sitting on the counter. Ugh. My immediate thought was to have a camera shipped by Amazon to our first stop. That worked perfectly, but considering what I was willing to spend I had to consider our options carefully. My main objective was to free us from the necessity to use our phones as cameras because I was looking for better battery life, more zoom capability, and ease of download to my laptop. Although this is a very tiny camera, it met those objectives. In fact, the ease of download greatly exceeded expectations with the flash drive transfer process. The camera has everything included, is easy to use, and produces reasonably good photos. I will leave the technical discussion of photo quality to the more avid photographers, but we are pleased. This will be a camera that accompanies us easily when we don't want to drag along the higher end photo gear. This is a smart bundle. The camera is tiny but powerful, and it comes with everything you need - cleaning supplies, SD card, card wallet, card reader to easily transfer pics to your computer, a tiny tripod, battery charger, case...  We bought it for our office to assist with documentation of events and for our newsletter.  Was ready to go within an hour of opening it and worked like a charm.  Reasonably priced and good bundle. I was surprisingly pleased with the package that I received.  The accessories are great.  I am especially amazed at the multi-slot USB card reader because I have a lot of different memory cards from various devices and I was able to load them and transfer files to an SD card.  The mini tripod is easily collapsible.  I liked the SD card storage pouch although one of the pockets was not attached (the thread came loose).  I tried to use the screen protector, but I couldn't get it smoothed out, and I didn't like the bubbles  due to lack of clarity on the screen.  The camera case is just right for the camera and SC card storage, but nothing else.  The BEST part of the package is the Canon camera.  I was replacing a Polaroid digital camera that had a larger screen; but I couldn't be more pleased with the photos from this camera. Great camera and accessories. Came as described within the expected delivery date. I only wish it had a timer option for taking photos like our old camera.",1,1
"Cute jacket lots of style ! The material is very cheap and the borders are not real leather! Not worth it. Cute style, but the fabric is shiny and looks a little cheap. Runs big. This was for my daughter she love it Love this jacket!!! Seems light weight but yet it keeps me warm! I bought a size up to wear thick sweaters under For the winter. It runs small. Ordered a larger size. I am very skinny girl, normally wear XS to S and I ordered a Medium size. It fitted right and comfortable to wear other clothing under (when it's colder out) Today was very rainy and cold in Boston and this helped me a lot!!! It's cozy and it kept me warm. It's very well constructed and I received a couple of compliments on it. Most important it did it's work. I was warm and protected under the rain. Size:  Medium Fits as expected.",1,1

"These sneakers are worth the extra few dollars for my son.  I'm learning quickly that he goes through shoes way too quick because when he plays, he plays hard.  But he's had these a few months and they still look brand new.  He loves them and the shoe strings are long enough for him to practice and perfect tying he shoes! Great sneakers--perfect for my VERY active seven-year-old son.  Seem to be holding up well after a month of use. My son loves these shoes, they look nice and fit well.  The only reason I wouldn’t give 5 stars is that the shoe laces are not long enough and they are hard to tie. Fell apart after a week and I had to return them.  I have never had problems with Under Armor shoes. Nice sneakers! My son loves them. My grandson loves these shoes He loves them. The fit like expected",1,1

It was the best thing i ever ordered for my windows. I absolutely love it and told all my friends about it.  No streaks anywhere on my windows. It is all that is promised and then some.. i am going to order more. I love these they are incredible Love it...it did take awhile to get it in the mail These are awesome. It works! I love the Norwex cloths. They put a shine on things and actually keep my windows from getting so dirty. I love it! Wouldn't clean windows any other way! Works like a wonder. Just add water and clean.,1,1

"I like this machine a lot. I ordered it here on Amazon and I've had it for about 3 years now. Wanted to wait to write a review! I've used this machine on all kinds of materials including lots of canvas and even vinyl. The heaviest thing I've sewn on it were faux leather (vinyl) purse straps which I had to sew through 4 layers of!! After adjusting the tension, it handled very well and did a great job. I've also sewn through those layers of vinyl on top of a very firm/thick layer of canvas on a very heavy weight stabilizer!! (As in sewing those purse straps onto the purse body which was constructed out of canvas and heavy heavy weight stabilizer).. So yes this machine can do heavy duty!! I've never had it break down or any major issues. I love that it comes with tons of presser feet. I most often use a walking foot because, well, why not!? Walking foot always gives the best results, in my opinion (maybe because I'm a lazy sewer who doesn't like to pin or iron or baste or any of that! Lol)... I recently used the embroidery portion on 5 pillows I made for a lady out of her grandpas old button up shirts. That feature came in handy for sure!! While you can't do anything too big or fancy with the embroidery, it still has its pros, and I didn't buy this to do embroidery anyway. One day I'll have the money to buy a real deal embroidery machine. This machine compares very favorably with the current Bernina 550, for a fraction of the price. Singer's touch screen is superior, as it is not only a color screen -- theirs isn't -- it is much clearer. There is no comparison in terms of the appearance of the two machines. This Singer is flat out gorgeous in person, and it's purple. Singer has really knocked it out of the park in terms of presentation with this one. The photos here do not begin to do it justice. I literally gasped when I pulled it out of the box.  I do miss having a knee lifter on this machine, which my Singer 580 embroidery machine has, but the superb quality of the 9985 considering its low price is ample consolation. I have an old Singer Sears fully mechanical sewing machine that was made in 2005. This new Singer 9980 is a dream to use. Auto tensioning is wonderful, stitch selection is great, customization is just awesome.",1,1
"My son loves to pretend that he wears glasses.  He wears these EVERYWHERE and they've held up great! My 5 year old loves these for costumes and dress up. He has a small head and they are comfortable for him to wear. Bought these for my daughter because she wanted to look like me (lol). She loves them. Awesome book I loved it!! My grandaughter loves these! She wants to wear them everywhere. They already broke!! And way too big for ""kids"" glasses. Good deal for the prize, and my son look super cute!  :) Very good quality for fashion glasses!",1,1
"These shoes are so adorable. I usually wear size 8 but I have wide feet so I ordered a size up to be careful and when they came they were actually abit loose and big which really surprised me since my feet is also fat and chunky but I don’t really mind. I have room for my toes and I love it. I can still walk in them perfectly fine. :”) I really really love the way these look and feel when I have them on. The only issue is that they are a bit ornery to get on (the back wants to fold under your heel and is difficult to get a finger in to arrange it correctly. Other than that, these are super cute, and an added bonus for where I live -  these are excellent on snow and ice because of the tread! Cute shoes. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because they run extremely small. I recommend getting one whole size bigger. These are even prettier in person and not bad quality for the price. Bought for a friend, she was so happy!!! they are a tiny bit big for a 6.5 but fit okay. easy to walk, heal isn't too high. I like them. Comfortable and pretty. Fit as expected. They looked great  - material on strap is a bit flimsy - just too hard for me to buckle.  Even if buckle is set at loosest setting - too hard to just slip foot in.",1,1

"So cute!  So glittery...be aware though, over time, the glitter does eventually start to wear away around the holes and where the belt slides in and out of the buckle. Very sexy and glitter stays on... I was concerned the glitter would fade and go all over the place, but it's not made like that. Good quality! Went well with the dress I wore to a wedding. great SUPER cute and great quality! Extremely cheaply made - it cracked the first time I buckled it. It seems to be made of some kind of cardboard - it's stiff and as I already said, it cracked on first use. Don't waste your money on this. Rough material and loose glitter. Don't wear long sleeves or they'll snag on your belt. Cheaply made. I had it a month and the backing came off.",1,1
"Purchased these as a gift for my son. Fit exactly as expected. Amazing quality and great price. Plan to purchase additional items again in the future. Highly recommend. They look exactly as pictured, they are not small rings. They are a bit oversized but that's what I was looking for. I would buy them again. Good for the price but very big rings Cool rings for the price sizing was too small get a 13 if you need a 12, a 14 if you need a 13 etc... I need too lose some weigh so maybe in a few months they’ll fit... fit as expected, bought as a christmas gift for my brother & he wears it daily. Very nice rings ... very happy with this purchase. One of the best rings I have bought.",1,1
"We began playing indoor field hockey in the off season and it was suggested that we buy an indoor field hockey sneaker from an online field hockey company. LOVE these shoes. They are so comfortable and fit perfectly 7.5. The color is nice too. Great for indoor sports. Great just like the previous Asics Gel rocket shoes that I had from 4 years ago. Hope these will last just as long. I tried to figure out how they fit compares to Nike. Nike I have to get 1/2 size bigger. Another review I read said buy what you would in Nike.  I think they fit a little bigger than nike’s Do. Next time I’ll get the same size as addidas. I have been wearing the Rockets for tennis for several years.  They are lightweight and provide enough support for lateral movement. My daughter has had several pairs of Asics for volleyball. They seem to be the best fit for her. They also last longer than Mizunos and Nikes we have tried in the past. We seem to always go back to ASICS. I am a squash player and have been really happy with many models Asics has made. Unfortunately all the good models have been discontinued so I tried this along with 3 other models currently on sale. This shoe has a hard and flat foot bed with no arch support. I have a medium foot width but this shoe does not hold the front part of the foot well for side to side movement, regardless of how tight one pulls the laces from the beginning of where the laces start. I like these shoes.  Use for pickle ball.  Have good side to side support.  I wear 8 in ""regular"" shoes, got an 8 1/2 -- always do with sport shoes. My daughter loves these and hated the Muzunos. They were too tight on her feet. These fit much better. She wears the same size in both brands though. She normally wears a 7 and had to get an 8.",1,1

thanks seller! very good quality speaker!! I am actually pretty surprised that a small speaker like this could produce this quality.  Good value for money. Don't get fooled by its size and price. This is a beast. Sound quality is as good as JBL flip 4 (JBL is little better on base) but with fraction of its price.,1,1

"I was hoping this was engraved into the ring, but they just frosted the curse onto the ring, could potentially scratch off... The ring was great when it came, the sizing was perfect, and the look and style were beautiful, especially the etchings.  I loved showing it off.  But after a week of wear, and I don't work so I wasn't doing anything but wearing it, the ring got scratched up and the engraving wasn't even noticeable anymore.  I ended up returning it. So beautiful. Actually engraved on outside and lazer etched on inside. I love it. It's not too bulky, and it fit perfectly. I have accidentally left it on while washing my hands and the script has not faded or whithered yet, so I can proudly say that I am satisfied with this ring. My precious.... A good ring at a great price. Can't go wrong with 5 bucks ya know? perfect ring to use as a replacement or when you are on vacation. It's pretty cool it's a bit thinner than I thought I would be looks better quality in the picture The product is a bit less rounded and shiny than the image shown but it made my son's face have about the biggest smile.  Well worth it!",1,1
"Very dainty rings. Very sparkly. A bit scratchy, due to the prongs, but still, I like them, I love the way these rings look! I got an extra band so it would be at least 4 bands stacked. I might even add a 5th band. Very pretty and sparkly! I got size 5 and fits good when all together rings are hard to wear because they are rough on the edges and catch hair and fabric in the edges . They rough up skin on you finger. When you run you fingers along the outside edge it is rough and sharp These rings are absolutely beautiful.  I love them.  I strongly recommend!!!!!!! So beautiful. I'm wearing one at a time with my original wedding rings. Very pretty. Great look So the pictures are better than the actual rings. One of the rings is rough and catches on my clothing. I wouldn’t buy again. Love this ring set so far. They are beautiful stacked together and make a great set. Only downside, is they get caught on a few pieces of my clothes because they are a bit rough feeling. Overall-such a perfect set.",1,1
"I'm soooooooo happy with this purchase. Lately I've been drinking more and more tea and I wanted/want to try different brands and different flavors to see what I like. This is by far the best way I feel to do so. I only got a few dupes (3 of one and 2 of another) and the rest were all different. In my view it was super worth while and will be trying other sampler boxes again and or buying this one again at a later date (gotta get through some of the tea first). I will say I've already tried the Chamomile (which I normally don't care for, but they were surprisingly good... there were 3 different kinds) and the a jasmine...which I didn't care for.... and the other 2 I've had so far were pumpkin spice... which I found to be kinda lack luster and then lastly the white chocolate mocha....which I didn't get a strong mocha taste, but a strong chocolate one and I loved that!. A box of many small treasures to savor - we fell in love repeatedly with the heady fragrances and exotic aromas of these Stash Teas. When February temperatures careened to arctic lows, opening warming stations and bursting pipes, our drafty New England kitchen found us draped in afghans, hoodies, and scarves, gloved hands curled like cats around steaming mugs of fragrant flavor. Raspberry, jasmine, vanilla, red velvet, mint ... hearty cinnamon. Wave after gentle wave whispering of winters inevitable sluicing melt into spring ... breathing deep these reminders that blueberries and mango waited patiently for the warm arms of summer. Yeah, you get a lot of tea bags but the box is a flimsy thing and it arrived crushed in multiple places (was sealed inside a plastic bag and shipped in a hard sided box that showed no damage). The box itself is far from ""adorable"" as description states -- it's just a cheap box with a printed ribbon and to reiterate, it was crushed. Teas were crammed in the box facing different directions and upside down. I indeed purchased this to give as a gift but will have to find a different box before I wrap it. Stash teas are great so I purchased this as a gift for a tea lover. This is a really great assortment of teas. I would definitely recommend buying this if you're looking for a nice variety of flavors. The box that I got had a mixture of green, white, black, and herbal teas. I've already discovered some new favorites! This would also make a nice little gift for someone who enjoys tea. Stash teas are my favorite for herb teas and their various green and black teas are good too.  This sampler provides a generous sample of their offerings.  I like to have the sampler on hand so visitors can select just what they like.  And, if you particularly like some of the ones you sample, you can then order a full box of it at your leisure.  If you have never tried Stash teas, you are in for a treat.  They are full flavored and has a wonderful aroma.  Give their tea a try, you will be glad you did.  I also appreciate the packaging.  Each individual bag is sealed in its own packet.  That insures that the teas, especially the herbal teas stay fresh until brewing. I bought this as a gift for my mom. She loved it and said there was a great variety. Nice variety of teas. but the description is deceiving. Its states gift box. The box is flimsy and I thought that there was an actual bow on the box. I assumed that a gift box meant something far better I actually would have sent it back but I paid extra to have it sent right away as a gift. I had to dress the box up myself. So if you just want a variety of teas this is your purchase but if you think that its a gift box move on.",1,1

"Update to below review: THE BOOT STYLE HAS CHANGED. OLD STYLE RUNS SMALL. NEW STYLE HAS PERFECT SIZING These boots are beautiful, comfortable, and warm. The heels are not too high, so they're good for walking. Not recommended for very thick legs, but for slender to average these should be amazing. 5'4"", 118lbs, shoe size normally 5.5. Ordered size 6 and fits perfectly, as the lining is thick and warm. Wonderful customer service, too! 5 stars: total winner. Dream Pairs is  becoming my favorite name in shoes.  I never thought I would be able to wear boots. I'm 5'10 and 170 pounds. It's very  difficult for me to fit into any trend.  Decided to give it a try and for $30 why not.  The second I put them on I am in love! They fit very well. They are comfortable. They stay up (what? Unheard of). I'm going to have so much fun working these into my wardrobe.  Can't wait! Love it Ordered the khaki ones but they are slightly darker than I expected (more like taupe). Not a big deal as they are still neutral and very comfy. Easy to pull on and off (used them to travel recently) and they really helped keep me a little warmer.  Normally wear a 6.5 and ordered a 7 and it fits perfectly.  They cling fairly well and are very soft to touch.  Love the style. I love them, they're so comfy and great for going out! Easy to walk in too I'm 5' 6 and I ordered 11 B(M) US. I was ready to get disappointed because ordering shoes online isn't as easy buying in store because the size chart and whatsoever. As I put these on, turned they fit perfectly and I am super happy about it! These boots look super great and they are good quality. I'd recommend this to anyone. Wow.  These boots look great!  I've wanted a pair of over the knee boots for a while, but hadn't been able to find a pair that were comfy in the knee area. These are made of a really soft, thick suede-like material that have some stretch. I haven't worn them outside yet, but I think they're going to help keep me warm while wearing dresses in the 4 degree temps we've got going on right now.",1,1
"I loved that the band is ultra thick and it stands up in its own on a dress without flapping all over the place like some belts the only downsides were that it was HUGE on me and it wrinkled easy. Tightened to the last hole I could still put half my arm between my stomach and the inside of the belt. I ultimately returned it because the dress I was matching with I thought was pink but it turned out to be a true red. If the belt had been red I would’ve kept it solely on the fact of how wide the band is, it’s hard to find a belt that wide. nice color nice quality. Great Belt for the $$$$",1,1

"The shirt is dark blue, not turquoise as advertised. The size is a very large Male's size not Junior women's. The advertised photo shows the image comes to the bottom of the shirt and it actually is positioned towards the top. The image on the shirt is significantly smaller than the picture advertised. Also, the image on the shirt received is very dull and does not have the same white and black contrast. Such a cute shirt! I am not a junior but a mother of three with a rather large bust. Depending on the shirt, I usually wear a small in women's to a medium if it's fitted across the bust so I wasn't sure what size I should get in this but a medium ended up being perfect! The color is so pretty and the graphic looks great. I wore it for a Dr. Suess themed breakfast on our recent cruise and I had several people ask me where I got it. Awesome shirt! Got lots of compliments on Dr Seuss day. Throwing a birthday party for my kids, boy and girl, so I had to come up with a coed theme. Cat in the hat it is!  The kids and I are going to wear themed shirts mainly so all of the parents know who we are (the whole kinder class is invited). I ordered this shirt and was a little nervous about the sizing. I am a woman's medium so I ordered this in XL because I didn't want it to be too snug. It fits great! I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it! We're looking forward to the party! Perfect shirt for Dr. Seuss day! I was nervous about the size but it’s perfect. I’m 5’1” and about 100 pounds. I usually wear xs. I ordered a small since this was juniors and it’s a perfect fit!! I purchased for Read Across America day at my toddler's school.  The kids were fascinated by my shirt. Got here fast... looks great! Shirt is adorable! Same color and size as pic! I wear an adult medium or large. I got the XL in juniors.",1,1

"I purchased both the Fastsnail dock and Fastsnail AC adapter, and since Amazon is grouping the reviews for these two items together, I'm doing one review for both. This is a portable and convenient option for an extra switch dock with the added bonus of also being able to be used as a charging stand when you don't have a TV available. There are, however, a few minor inconveniences you should be aware of: I looked all over for the PlayStation branded stand for the new PS4 models, but as many have realized, stocks are low or gone. This stand does the SAME THING and is VERY stable. I am impressed that this product is literally the same thing for a fraction of the price. Personally, I would prefer straight edges, but the curves aren't really noticeable when the console is sitting among other electronics. It is thin, stealthy, and surprisingly stiff. I did a little test by nudging my PS4 several times to see if I could knock it over, and it stood up just fine without a single wobble. I works just like a standard dock at a much much much cheaper price. No complaints. Worked right out of the box. Works perfectly at a much lower cost than other docks. Just make sure you detach joy-cons and have 5V of USB power so that it goes into dock mode properly. This makes taking my Switch to a friend's place insanely easy. Yup I got it and it works! The first one I bought from you guys didn't so that left a sour taste in my mouth. But this new Switch stand is working like it should and I hope it won't crap out on me any time soon. 👍 Great for the price. You'll need to buy the power source and HDMI cable for it. Dock only! Great for putting in a travel case. Can be a little difficult to pull the switch out of the dock. This could be an issue for smaller kids. But, that means it holds the console well. For the money, this is a great replacement, add on for a 2nd TV in the home or wanting to be able to travel with it and hook it up anywhere easily. Works as described.",1,1

"While these bags are very cute, and would be super functional if they were more durable, I am disappointmented in their quality. I purchased two of these bags.  The zipper on one broke after one use, and the zipper on the other broke on day two of use.  Too, the loose threads inside interfere with the zipper. For the price a very good bag. It will hold much more than you might expect from the photos. For the price, this is an amazing little bag. I was worried about reviews regarding the zippers.  Mine came with them seemingly out of order HOWEVER I pull them back to the edges and they align themselves and work just fine.  I will update on the durability of the purse.  It looks like what I was looking for but is indeed much smaller thenin the photo but also roomy with many pockets etc.  All in all it is just what I was looking for.  Something to wear to festivals and flea markets and hikes and thrift shop hunting.  Will update as to durability when appropriate. Love the bag, even ran into another guy with the same bag who noticed it right away. One problem with it is that the key ring is inside the pouch rather than the outside. It's still use able but a loss less convenient when hooking and unhooking your keys. perfect for a small tablet(7-9 inch). replaced my wallet. Looks ok on pictures but when seeing live really looks the materials used looks cheap it has a hole in one of the border of cover lower layer. I absolutely love this bag! It's a perfect size to carry all of my stuff and it's tall enough to fit a water bottle standing up as well. There are 4 different compartments that are all decently sized. Really dig this bag. Perfectly for my weekdays when I carry a lot of crap to work each day. Fits well on my shoulder and keeps its shape - it is strong on the seams and the zippers. Tons of pockets and pouches for organizing all my goodies.",1,1
"I like the other 2 items I got but the pot in the picture was a disappointment. The glass lid was chipped, which is something I can ignore but it also doesn't fit the pot!! It just won't stay put. I bought this because I broke the glass lid of my granito pot (different brand) and now I have a granito pot with a lid that can easily fall and break because it keeps moving. It was the worst buy I've made lately. The pots have already peeled and on the first day of use they stained, and from that, the food began to stick, and the purpose of having a ceramic coated pan, would not stick the food. I need to buy another cookware kit as it has spoiled in less than a month of use. Not worth it.one of the pots is already scarred..the surface is useless it chips off easily. amazing set, after 4 months of daily use, remains intact, and looking great Good nonstick cookware set. Used it few times, so far so good. This stone ware is great! Easy to clean and cook with. I also appreciate being able to buy 3pcs. I only cook for one.",1,1
"I bought this Inateck FE2005 and installed a Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD, however the FE2005 does not work. The first time I plugged it into a USB 3.0 port, the LED flashes blue and so on, so I try to copy a huge file to check the speed and it started at 300+ MB/s but after a few seconds it reduces to 0 bytes/s and becomes unresponsive, file transfer usually stuck at whatever percentage it reached at that point. Sometimes it even causes Windows to become unresponsive until I unplug the usb cable. The tool less design of this was very intuitive and fast to set up. I put an old 256gb SSD that i replaced on my computer with a better one in it and plugged it into my xbox, which saw it immediately and asked if I wanted to save media to it or if i wanted to format it to install games. If I would change anything I would put the LED on the other side of the cord so I could have the LED in the front and the cord in the back to hide it. It's very small so it is easy to hide the entire thing. I'm getting load times that are almost half of my internal drive. Many of us have two needs in such a product. We often need something temporary, that is relatively quick and easy to put a disk into and out of. Products that do this well, typically offer no protection for the drive and are not suitable for longer term use. And we need something to use as an external enclosure for backup and similar purposes which provides protection for the drive. No more tiny screws in the metal CoolMax body to remove, possibly lose, then reassemble. The CoolMax USB3 had the speed; but not fast for swapping. I've been using the Sabre USB2 drive adapters with the separate power cable and the USB cable for some years; but wanted some way to keep the bulky and involved method in a smaller way in my drawer. I am amending my review from three stars to four because of the amazing customer service I encountered from Inateck. Shortly after posting this review, I was contacted by Inateck offering a replacement of my defective item. I did not initiate this contact with Inateck, they were completely proactive and shipped me a replacement in a very timely manner. Very impressed with their customer focused service and will update my review further assuming the device holds up over the next few months. I wasn't sure what to expect, since this was from a manufacturer I was not familiar with and it was priced low. Imagine my surprise when I received a very nicely constructed enclosure that works exactly as described. Yes, it's simple plastic, but it's precisely formed plastic.",1,1

"These are super soft. Fit perfectly, however I was nervous to wash them sknce the are 95% cotton. Washed in cold... Still shrunk a little. They still fit just more snug then I would like. I would suggest going a size up. I love these. I am a US size 6-8 and the medium size fits well. They stay in place and don't ride up. They shrunk a bit after first wash but have enough stretch to fit well. I'll be ordering more. I love this quality and fabric feel. I got a large and I am 5’4 140 lbs. These are really too small on me. Since they're underwear I can make it work, but when I pull them up high enough to cover my crack they are too small to cover the cheeks, and therefore a constant wedgie situation. I love these! Very comfy ! Basic and comfortable These are perfect, lightweight and comfortable. I will definitely buy more Bargain for your buck. These are great to have for under leggings and just lazy days at home. Good quality material and breathable. I plan on buying more.",1,1
"So beautiful, i got this to match my husband's wedding band and to replace my old wedding set that was breaking.. my original set we got from a pawn shop for a little under $200 and had to fix it a while back for another $200, and now it's breaking again so we decided to get me a new set/band and I found one that matches his perfectly(this one) and I love it so much! It's a little loose but my fingers tend to swell up so that's not a big deal. It was cheap and beautiful. I love the simplicity of it compared to my old set. don't be afraid to purchase this ring.  We looked in jewelry store before purchasing and they were 300.00 and up for one just like this and I was skeptical at first but thought I wouldn't be out much money by ordering.  When this ring arrived I was astounded at how nice it was.  Have your finger sized before purchasing. I would say save money and get your rings from here! I love this ring!! Looks and feels great. Size rungs true to size. Looks and feels excellent. Its surprisingly heavy for how small it but that makes it feel really durable. The only problem is the black color does fade after a while. it was a Beautiful ring but unfortunately i have to return it as it is not the size i believed it would be, but all in all it is a beautiful ring and it came very quickly I love my wedding ring! Very pretty. My wife liked it. She was glad to have a cheap durable ring for work. I completely love my wedding band. It fits snug and comfortable and the ring is even more beautiful in person and on my hand than online in a picture. More women should buy this ring. My NaNa Chic wedding band even looks beautiful with my engagement ring. They go together perfectly!! I will be buying more NaNa Chic jewelry very soon! I completely love it and will be telling all my women friends about NaNa's jewelry. It is a must have!!",1,1
"I am torn in reviewing this toy.  Here's why:  The toy is definitely well-made, will not come apart, will not break unless subjected to massive violence.  It definitely builds motor skills, hand-eye-coordination, and even thinking skills--as deciding which colors should be up or down or evenly matched in height requires some intricate choice and physical application.  So, the toy is a great toy! I was excited to buy this for my 9 month old boy, should have realised something was wrong when I saw fine sawdust in the package. Was beyond shocked when I opened it up and saw holes drilled all over by wood-borers/wood-worms or whatever creepy-crawlies. And they were alive! Peeping out of the holes now and then to take in their new neighbourhood. Trashed them almost immediately but still can't get over it, and to think my boy loves chomping on almost anything he gets his hand on. My 20 mo old sits and plays with this thing often. He doesn't like the hammer too much, so instead he pushes the pieces down one by one with his hands. He laughs when the opposite side pieces pop up. This was a gift for my 16 month old nephew. He loves his tool bench and banging things, so I knew this would be right up his alley. The mallet has helped his fine motor skills and he liked that it was light enough for him to carry around. He did use the mallet to bang on other things but that wasn't an issue for his parents. He's almost 2 now and still goes back to this toy from time to time, so it's not something he's used at one age and hasn't touched again which is nice. It's great quality and has lasted through his rough stages! I love melissa and doug products but this one didnt live up to their name. It fell apart after we had it for about 2 weeks. I tried to put it back together but had no luck. I originally gave this 5 stars within a month of gifting this to our son for Christmas. A year later it is barely holding up (despite lack of play!) and the colored pegs don't stay in the up position. Key word here is despite the lack of our son playing with this toy, it has deteriorated. I would definitely not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it to others with children  9months and up. My 2 yr old got this for X-mas, and he LOVES it! The ""gears"" that pop the pegs up on the other side is an EXCELLENT feature. This pounding bench can take a beating and it entertains him for a decent amount of time before he's off to some other toy. It's solid wood and very sturdy. It can take all the abuse a rough and tough toddler can dish out. It's been beat on, tossed around, and thrown to the ground and it's still in one peice. Melissa and Doug make some of the best toys available. Their toys are simple but still fun for kids, and they are always well made and high quality. I'm very pleased with this toy and would recommend it to anyone with a little one that likes to bang on things. TIP: The hammer will leave marks on wooden surfaces, little half moon rivets. It's best if used on a mat or non wooden hard surface. We learned this the hard way... Bought this toy for my 2 year old nephew.  It is not what I expected it to be.  It looks like & has the same basic concept of the classic toy I use to play with when I was a child.  It is good wood but it has one terrible flaw.  The pegs don't fit snugly into the board!  Which is the whole point of this item!  It can be pushed down with a finger without any effort at all (by a child) & it is so loose that it does not stay the level you hit it at.  Also, now that i think of it, having the pieces fall out was also half the fun of the toy.",1,1
"Item as described, fits perfect...The review is for the blue T-shirt, but for some reason it's posting under a shirt that i have ordered but has not shipped yet could this be why it's taking so long for that order to ship?

"I have a tendancy to play with my belly button rings and sometimes that means the design scrapes my skin. The only part of this ring that isn't flush with the metal is the opal setting on the top ball, which doesn't come into contact with my skin at all. Seems to be quality, pretty! Very nice. Great quality, pretty as well. It is beautiful Great quality and very attractive. As described. No irratation whatsoever. SOOOOOO pretty oh I love it, and well made",1,1

"I am a server in a typically fast pace environment so I was searching for shoes that would help me get through long shifts without my ankles, heels and knees hurting to the point where I could barely walk. I came across these after much research. After reading every review possible I decided that these would be a good fit. They run a little big. I always use some kind of memory foam or other insert. I used the insert on top of the inserts that came with the shoe and they fit fine. They are water resistant as well. I work in a busy supermarket and have to be in all departments and these are holding up well. I would definitely buy again and recommend. The groovy pattern makes me the coolest old lady at work. These shoes are the best thing I’ve ever found. I work on my feet on concrete floors averaging 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. I have had 2 major surgeries on both of my feet. My toes on my left foot curl and I have a callus on my toes from the fact that they curl. I work in a restaurant and will rate these for kitchen use. I never know what I was missing until I bought these! I used to slip around at my work place but now I don't even have to worry about it and I can work more efficiently! I should have bought these sooner. Best shoe for standing and walking on concrete all day (12hr). I go home from work and my feet do not hurt😃 So far so good. They aren't the world's most comfortable shoes, but they are much better than typical safety shoes sold at work places. The colors are cute, and any icing I've dropped on them comes off clean with no staining. The floor grip is good, but the low top rubs my ankles a little bit. This shoe is comfortable.",1,1
"These t-shirts are great!  I bought four and have worn them every day at work for eight months now.  They show no signs of wear after fairly rugged use.  They fit exactly as they should and it's great not having a tag in the back.  They seem to breathe better than the traditional cotton tshirts I have bought in the past.  If I ever need to replace these I will definitely buy again! Pros: I decided to take the Steve Jobs / Mark Zuckerberg model. I bought 5 of these and wear 1 to work each day and then wash them over the weekend for the next week. Feels so much more efficient and I would recommend people do this. The initial fit is a tad bit loose, I wouldn't even say loose, comfortable is the better work. When you wash it, it does shrink a bit so keep that in mind. Not sure why though because it's not 100% cotton as the description states. It's 60/40. The washed fit is a slim fit which I actually prefer so worked for me. The price of this shirt was so great I thought it may be too good to be true and was worried about fit and quality. I have a very active 15 year old son who abuses his clothing. To my surprise this shirt fits him perfectly and he said it is one of the most comfortable shirts he owns. We moved to Florida from Wisconsin so we are all getting used to the heat down here and he really wanted some ""dry"" technology shirts that would wick away sweat. This shirt does the job nicely. It fit perfectly, seems to be holding up well, is comfortable, and was such a great deal I ordered it for him in other colors. Definitely recommend for athletic types. I bought these for my husband and we received them very quickly. They are different from the ones I bought from walmart. They are so light and soft I want to wear them too. We love these shirts and will keep buying from this company The shirt material is relatively soft and lightweight, which makes it comfortable and breathable. However, it is not a very long shirt, and it runs slightly baggy.  I'm 6'1"" and 180 pounds.  I ordered a large, and it is fairly loose around the waist and chest, yet it barely comes down past my waistline.  If you're 6' or taller, I recommend looking for a different shirt, because this one simply isn't long enough. Good fit and quality. Thicker and smoother than the X-Temp with Fresh IQ. This is better for daily wear whereas X-Temp with Fresh IQ is targeted towards exercising I guess. After trying several brands and several material combinations, these are my favorite.  They hold their color well, come out of the dryer unwrinkled and are very comfortable and wick moisture away well.  They're pretty much perfect.",1,1
"This light switch and the other outlet style plug has worked reliably for over 3 years. There would be occasional hiccups like power interruptions that cause the switches to restart, but they have never failed on me. However, you are at the mercy of your internet connection and if you happen to be away while the network crashes, you won't be able to communicate with the switches. The daily programs will continue to work regardless. I purchased this item from Amazon on January 9th, as a pre-order from when they were released as a new item on January 10th, 2017. After receiving two defective units from Amazon, and before returning the second, I decided to play around with it more and do some more research online. I am posting this to help anyone else who purchased this and is having trouble getting it to connect to your local WiFi network. I did get the unit working fine, but I removed two stars from my review because of the hassle of getting it to work. I spent over an hour with WeMo tech support, who offered no solutions, and made me jump through a bunch of hoops in the process. Cycling a reboot of my router did nothing. Changing my WiFi password did nothing. Disconnecting my phone from cellular service did nothing. The issue with these early units lies in the fact that they seem to get ""confused"" if you have other WeMo devices in your home. When trying to set up this WeMo mini, the WeMo app on my iPhone would find the device after I connected to its WiFi. The screen would show the device, ask me to name it, and click ""Next"". After clicking next, it would get stuck trying to get the device to find my home WiFi network. I have 4 other ""older"" WeMo devices (none of which ever had any issue connecting). I have a WeMo light switch, and 3 regular WeMo smart plugs. Two of the other WeMo smart plugs were easily accessible, so I tried completely unplugging them (not just turning them off). I did a factory reset on the WeMo mini I purchased, went through the app process of connecting it again, and voila! It immediately found my WiFi network and connected. And then it immediately downloaded a firmware update. So it seems like WeMo is aware of an issue, yet their tech support wasn't informed. And so far, I seem to be the only one publicly acknowledging the issue with these early release devices and buggy firmware.",1,1
"Great fit, great look...can't beat the price either! Nice, they are strong. My kids played with them pulling them on and off (they are 2 and 5) Great glassss they won't break easy cause there bendable! I was really happy with the first pair I bought. Always a bit of a gamble buying something that needs to fit based on pictures. Fit was good. Glasses are comfortable enough to wear through the entire day. I decided to buy three more pair as back up. I am very good at misplacing and/or breaking eyewear. What I got though was three pairs glasses that were a completely different style. Mind you I used the order again option and double checked the product page so it wasn't just me rushing through pressing buttons. Instead of the glossy smooth finish this frame consists of I got a chunky matte finish frame more akin to cheap sunglasses. I suppose someone would be ok with the style but it felt horrible on my face and looked bad on me as well. I sent them back via amazon's return service and got my money back no issue but I'm really hesitant to try again. I don't want to get caught in a cycle of purchases and returns. Product itself deserves five stars for being exactly what the page claims it to be especially at the more than fair pricing but with the possibility of getting something completely different I'd put it at more of a 3.5 I popped the lens out and got lots of compliments. Used for fashion. I bought these frames for my 15 yr. old grandson who is 'expressing' himself with clear-glass frames.  I was concerned about the purchase because while he does show good taste that taste is very definite.  He liked them and wears the frames all the time.  Whew!!! I received my purchased pair with a large scratch on the left lense from top to bottom of oyter corner. Im not sure if the manufacturer sent it like that or if it was from the packaging and delivery process. It is a good product. I have bought these before and had no problems, just missplaced them and they got jacked. The glasses are cool looking, but it would be nice if the lens actually fit into the frame! The left lens is not even set in the glasses. Quality control needs to do a better job, because even if it got out of the factory slightly dislodged, I should still be able to gently reseat it.  There is no way that that lens fits this Frame I'm definitely going to request a return if I'm not too lazy to do so",1,1

"Neutral rating as package was open and a candle is missing. Luckily I don’t need the full 6 but that’s not the point. Zero quality control in packaging. Very nice! I got no candles with this order....so mad I give no starts These are cute. Probably were not necessary for our Toy Story party, but they were still a cute touch. It actually comes with 6 candles, so there was more to this than I thought. They're candles. Received early! Loved these candles for my sons 3rd birthday! Candles were perfect for my son's Toy Story cake! I never actually opened the package b/c I used a number candle instead but these are still cute candles.  I paid a few dollars for them and thought that to be reasonable... they're selling for under $1 now so I would definitely say they're worth the money!",1,1

"I have used these to light my living room in soft and low lighting for two years. They are beautiful at night when they light up, I always get compliments about them from new people who see them for the first time. While I must also have other lamps to have a fully lit room, for the purpose of evening tv viewing or assuring the room is lit when I come home at night, these things are the best. They never get hot, they are extremely safe, and again, they are simply gorgeous. I even bought another set to light my tree. Bought these as a gift for my mom, who was looking for some lights for one of her indoor plants. The typical non-LED Christmas string lights just do not last. These are beautiful and she loves them. They are nice and bright. Its hard to find short strands of led lights like this that are not battery operated. I'm getting some of these for myself! Very bright-it's hard to sit facing them at night at a close distance without it being a little too much (I use them on my small balcony. Just the same, they have weathered multiple storms and continue to work well.. They are almost invisible in daylight and the upper wire is easily manipulated around railings and banisters. Would probably be great for holiday lighting (without needing to take down between seasons). These are SO awesome I strung them around a black framed mirror I use to get ready each morning. The contrast of the copper and black looks great and the led lights are great for applying makeup in the morning. They don't get hot and it's simple to plug and unplug them. Great quality and price! I'm planning on incorporating them into more of my rooms! Wish all these companies would make one that uses an outdoor low 12 voltage option the solar never works for long enough. I love these twinkle lights.  The glow they provide is warm and inviting.  The best part is that they plug into the wall vs. a battery operated system.  We used theme for Thanksgiving and Christmas and anticipate using them multiple times throughout the year for many occasions.  Thank you! These little lights are great. The copper wiring makes it easy for the lights to hold a certain position, unlike regular wired lights. I have had them on for over 36 hours straight and they are in no way warm or hot to the touch. The lights feel like I just turned them on. The description says ""warm white"". My only complaint, and its really not a complaint, is that they are a little brighter than ""warm white"".  They still look great on my mantle. Im glad I purchased these little lights. Immediately tangled into a god forsaken mess. I stopped trying to untangle as it was completely harshing my christmas tree decorating vibe. Went out and bout the regular mini bulbs from walmart. These went to the trash.",1,1

"There are not 8 functions, There is no ""Maths"" mode, no Drum mode, Color Model, or Game Model. Once is starts lighting up, it's a lot like a strobe light. It is still cute, and doesn't cost much, but it does not do what it is advertised to do. If it does the instructions on the back of the packaging are not correct in describing how to do it (which isn't saying much because there are barely any instructions at all.) I purchased this for my son he is 7 months old. He loves lights and music so I thought this was a great toy for him to easily be entertained by. The phone works when it wants not always or when you touch the buttons.  I had it sitting next to us and it all of a sudden turns on by its self. I just thought that was very weird. Looks nice on the picture but is truly a waste of money.  Would not recommend I really was excited to give this to my 1 year old grandson as he always reaches for my phone. He really enjoyed it at first. However, it is only 6 week later and it no longer works. When I plug it in it made a clicking noise and then stopped working. To be fair the product says it is for 18 month olds and my grandson did throw it several times, but even an 18 month old throws and drops toys. This is the cheapest, most disappointing item I have ever ordered from Amazon. I believe there should be a published statement on items stating that not only are they made in China, but it's actually SHIPPED from China. It took forever to arrive, but more importantly it was just an awful product. The volume is way too loud for a child, or anyone for that matter, to put near their ear. No way to turn the volume down. I could go on and on about the different ways this item disappointed me, but I won't. Never again. Again, not Amazon's fault, but please ensure truth in advertising!! Very cheap - didn't even last a day and my baby never threw it down on the floor or anything. Broke (played sounds like a broken record) within 10 minutes of my 6month baby girl pressing the buttons. When my wife went to plug it in, in hopes of restarting it, the usb port snapped off the circuit board and is rattling around inside the phone. For 9 bucks I didn't expect too much but this pretty poor. Died after a couple times of being played with. Bought for my son so he’d leaves ours alone but that didn’t work because it didn’t last long at all smh. This is trash and there’s exactly where I put it this thing is a joke...total waste of money. 5 minutes in my 1 year old hand and it stopped working. buy something else...its waste of money",1,1
"I honestly love this watch it's fashionable and seems pretty sturdy. The package it came in wasn't in the best condition but that is on ups/USPS so I was a bit worried about it although once I opened up everything it was in perfect condition. The face of the watch is very nice easy to read read and keeps time well.  Very easy to adjust. The band is metal which is also nice and it'll fit any wrist. My only complaint would be with the hands I just wish they were a bit darker blue but that's not a big deal if you're on the fence about this watch get it it's very well made and nice looking. Worth every penny This is a lovely watch! My husband loves it! It looks very good on! It looks very dressy even though it can be worn for everyday use. It has large face and easy to read.  I would recommend to anyone. It comes with it's on case which he likes. Thanks for great quality product. Speaking as a watch fiend, I must say I get more thrill wearing this watch than any other watch I have ever owned. Got this product for fathers day and I must say since it is not branded , I had assumed that it may be a cheap looking item. But I was genuinely suprised at the quality. The big dial with the white background really makes the watch pop. Dad loved his product and I am happy I made this purchase. This is not only a really nice looking watch but seems high quality for the price as well. Mesh band is easily adjustable and face is large but not big enough that it looks weird. Came with a soft bag to hold the watch, the tool to adjust it and perhaps the instructions if you decide to keep them. Took just a couple minutes from receiving to having it set and fit on my wrist, would highly recommend. I was looking for a nice inexpensive watch for my son since he is not the best at taking care of his things. I ended up selecting this watch and my son loved it! My father-in-law was in town visiting and like it too so I ended up ordering him one as well! LOL So far so good! Great look, as advertised. The band is so comfortable...but was a little more difficult for me to adjust for me personally however once I go it, it became easier. The watch is super slim, again as advertised. Keeps time well, seconds hand is very quiet. Love it! I bought the same Songdu watch with a leather band on accident and it was pretty bad. Strap was pretty thick and it squeaked terribly when it moved. I bought this one (the one I actually wanted) and it was night and day different. The stainless steel mesh band is lightweight and comfortable. Breathes nicely! The watch face is easy to read and a good size. Not too big, not too small. Thin and doesn't feel too heavy on my wrist. It's a little tricky to adjust the placement of the strap lock, but once you get it to the right spot, you're golden. Highly recommend this item!",1,1

"These came across my Vine queue and as the summer months are nearly here wanted to try out some new underwear for my running. Other than the bands being sticky enough from their storage that lifting one pair made the other get pulled up as well from the residue on it, these came in good shape.  They are quiet comfortable, and really do breathe well. These are well made.  The waist band is flat and smooth, as are the seams.  The fabric is light eight, but not flimsy.  They recommend to wash in cold with non-chlorine bleach.  They do not recommend fabric softener.  Tumble dry low.  These are made in Vietnam. It's comfortable and it breathes, making me sweat less and it dries pretty quickly. This is great for the gym. My son says they are great.",1,1

"My sister recommended these wedges to me for wearing at work since I am on my feet a lot but still have to have a dressy shoe, and my goodness, I could seriously wear these shoes all day long!  They are fabulous!  It's like wearing nothing at all...  They don't squish my toes or the sides of my feet, they are so easy to walk in for the size of those heels, and they don't even rub my ankles like other ankle booties that I own.  The neutral color is also great (I bought the khaki color), so I can wear them with practically anything (even just my skinny jeans for running errands or date nights). I know people are skeptic about buying clothes online but these fit perfectly! They are so comfy and I love them so much!! I purchased this boot in both ""Tomson-nude Pu"" and ""Tomson-burgundy."" I was nervous about both colors for different reasons - the burgundy because I'm usually a person who only buys neutral-colored shoes that match everything, and the nude because I wasn't sure how plastic they'd look. Neither concern turned out to be an issue. The burgundy is beautiful, and subtle enough that I don't feel like they need to be worn sparingly. The nude is not overly-plastic-looking or overly-shiny as it looks in the photo. Both made my feet look smaller than they are, which was a pleasant surprise! They're also really comfortable, easy to walk in, and seem surprisingly durable for the price (although only time will tell). LOVE THESE! I haven't worn heels in years because they became to uncomfortable the older I got.  These fit so perfectly and are so comfy I wore these all day and night Christmas Eve. I only took them off cause I had to go to bed. Hubby doesn't like it if I were to wear shoes to bed, but he's weird like that. I will be ordering more of these in different colors. Love it goes with everything..comfort I am in love with you shoes. They're very comfortable. My feet are fairly wide after having 3 kids and shoes that are comfortable are hard to come by. These were super adorable and I couldn't pass up the chance to try them as they were very affordable. I got them in the mail today and I'm pleased to say they fit perfectly. The suede is very pretty navy blue and the detailing on the toe is subtle and elegant. I haven't worn them outside yet but I've worn them all around my house this afternoon and I don't have any soreness in my foot at all. I will probably Scotchgard them to protect them from any wet weather as I live in Colorado. I am very pleased with this purchase and I will update after wearing them Outdoors a few times. I was so excited to buy these based on the history of positive reviews. I really love how cute and comfy they are. I am super upset with the quality, however. I've only worn them a handful of times (5 at most) and the front soles on the backs of both booties are already peeling off (see photo). Very upset about this. So here's the thing. I love the shoes. I do. They're really cute, and comfortable. But I can only give 2 stars because I was sent the incorrect color not once, but twice.",1,1
"Nice belt but it takes a little getting used to. The primary issue is that it takes a lot of effort to put it through normal belt loops because of the end that the hook goes into is square and thicker than the rest of the belt. Other belts slide through easily because the are usually a little rounded/pointed at the end and are not thicker than the rest of the belt. This is a great belt. I have a similar belt but found it too stretchy and as a result it never felt tight enough. This one however has the right amount of stretch but no to soft. The belt I've been looking for. This belt turns my common jeans or shorts into comfortable commuting wear. Keeps the crack from showing and still allows me to breath! A little tight in the loops but I leave the belt in the pants til it's time to wash anyway. Great belt. This belt is awesome. Doesn't make a sound, feels great, looks great. Very nice, flexible use belt.  I've used this primarily for activities (golf) where it adjusts well to your movements.  Keeps your pants/shorts snug without feeling constricting.  Although I haven't tried, I would think it would also be very comfortable while sitting for long periods of time. Belt looks really nice and the fit is adjustable to be just right. Stays tight and doesn't slip. Great product.  So easy to use for active sports.  Lays nice and flat, so great to use under pack belts.  Highly recommend I love how easy it is to undo and refasten and I really like that it has no metal and so doesn't trigger the metal detector at airports. It's also entirely comfortable. The only downside is that it is just a bit wide to just slide through the belt loops on my pants, but the benefits outweigh that small disadvantage.",1,1

"Kinda wish I got a small instead of a medium, but I read previous reviews and ordered a size up. it fits fine I would of just preferred a little tighter and shorter. But I love it besides that! Looks great on color is poppin' I'm 5'7 and 147. I got a large and it fits like a medium, which is what I wanted. It's a nice light jacket for spring or summer. Def would not wear this in the winter I was hesitant about purchasing this jacket so I held off. I got a gift card to Amazon as a birthday gift and decided to use it for the jacket. I wish I hadn't stalled so much because I love this jacket. It's just what I was looking for. I'm 5'2 and petite. I ordered a small and it fits great. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it. If you're looking for a cheap version of the almost $200 bomber jacket , definitely get this one.  The only thing I recommend is if you're looking for an olive/dark green bomber ,definitely  get the ""Army Green"" not ""Army Green New"". The Army Green New comes green as can be. Not dark at all. They are both still cute though This jacket it's just like the picture and very  happy with it !  I'm 5'4 and weigh about 135 got a medium size and it fit perfectly . If you want this to fit you a little loose I suggest getting a size up . Came in earlier then expected. Love this jacket, so glad I went with a medium. Will purchase again! The jacket arrived extremely fast maybe a week and a couple days after I purchased it . I like the jacket but sadly it doesn't fit ;( I ordered a medium and usually my jackets are small but as stated the jacket runs small so I brought a size up . It's short on my torso I had to roll the sleeves up because it's too short anywho would I order again honestly yes but I guess instead of a medium I'll just have to order a large . That sucks but whatever it's a nice jacket just runs really small. Following other reviews, I bought a size up from my normal large and ended up returning the XL jacket the day I got it. It dwarfed me and fit like an XL so I can honestly say it's true to size despite other reviews. After returning said jacket I got the large instead and it fits perfectly. (For reference I'm 5'7, 180 pounds, bust size 38DD) The cuff hits right at the wrist and the bottom of the jacket falls just below the hip bone. That being said, this is an amazing jacket overall. I live in Florida so it's the perfect lightweight jacket and has become a huge staple in my wardrobe. I ordered the jacket BLACK5, which has a drawstring bottom (instead of the same band used for the cuffs and collar) outer front pockets (these are located just below the breast on the front), and no zippers on the sleeve. The jacket is silky smooth, has minimal noise (no swishing sound that's uber annoying), and looks expensive. The pockets are pretty decent as you can comfortably house your keys, cellphone, a small wallet, and my kindle also fits inside the pocket as well. I chose this specifically for the drawstring bottom and the zipper-less sleeves (I'm not a fan personally of zippers as an aesthetic) but be sure to pay attention to the subtle detail changes between the black jackets, that way you're actually ordering the one you want. I would recommend this company and jacket along with ordering the size you NORMALLY WEAR.  Great purchase.",1,1
"Shoe fits great, I ordered a size up originally (10) as suggested by previous reviews, I would advise against doing so. My athletic shoe size is a 9, and I found that I needed the corresponding size for this shoe as well, I would NOT order a size up if you currently wear an athletic shoe. Very comfortable for what they are, I would suggest insoles though. I do like that they're fairly light weight, and they don't scream ""safety shoe"" so you could just wear them wherever if it bothers you for people to know that you work. They don't start hurting usually until about 9 - 10 hours into my 12 hour shift, so I'll take it. They seem to be fairly durable as well, but time will tell. I've had them for a couple months now, but I've been switching them out with a couple other pairs to keep my work shoes lasting longer. So far so good. Took a couple weeks to work in, i am on concrete all day and i had a heel spur that would not go away, after a couple months i am not having any more problems and yes they run a little large so just get the size you usually wear Sole is nothing but a thin layer of hard rubber. Wearing these shoes on a hard surface for a work day render your feet useless.  I also now know what corns feel like. Tried 2 sizes as well. Larger size didn't fit and smaller size rubbed the corners of my toes to painful nubs. Can feel rocks and uneven surfaces through sole. Ordered one size smaller and it fit good length wise. Needed to add an insole to make snug around the foot because it had too much room. Where the shoe folds, until you break it in, it will crease into your foot which is rather uncomfortable. Now, after I have broken them in they are pretty comfy. I still would rather use my boots at work and only use these when I am having to walk back and forth alot so I'm not sure how long they will last if used daily. Toe cap is pretty sturdy. Be prepared to answer alot of questions about them when people see them because they do draw attention to your feet. These particular type of Puma steel toe shoes have been absolutely marvelous. Not only does it fit to size but has impeccable traction to wet surfaces. I'm on concrete slabs all day so dr. Scholl's inserts are recommended. But other than that satisfaction guaranteed! If and when they need a replacement I definitely will purchase a duplicate!!!! Wish the shoes where sold in half sizes I had to buy a size 11 because a size 10.5 was not an option. Shoes are a little big but still comfortable arrived in time. like these shoes. they look ok, fit properly. Already using daily for my job. like them, nothing wrong.",1,1
"Loved this bag so much. It is a perfect bag travelling for weekend and it can sit on top of carry-on luggage perfectly.  It is a very sturdy, durable bag, very roomy inside. What I love the most about this bag is the extra layer on the bottom. I can put shoes or dirty clothes there. I looked at other places but I rarely see a bag like this one.  So excited with this bag and thinking about buying again for holiday gifts!!! great bag! Great bag. It is everything I expect. I am very happy with the quality. Great bag! Glad I ordered it.",1,1

"These are about a 1/2 to 1/4 size smaller than the newer Wave lightnings and Bolts (just like people always warned in their reviews). These fit me perfectly, length-wise (I'm between 9.5 and 10 and ordered a 10), but were a bit snug, width-wise. Insole is NOT removable (may be a problem for active ankle braces). Good stability, decent heel-cushioning. NO arch support whatsoever (the insole is completely flat). These were a good price and the length was important for me (the newer size 10s mentioned above were a tad too long, which makes it annoying when going up onto my toes (e.g., when avoiding collisions at the net). I like to feel stable and nimble and have shock-absorption, which these shoes provided. And for the price I can put in arch supports. I play serious volleyball several times a week. I bought 2 pair size 10 and 11 and had to return both. :( I have purchased Mizuno Women's Wave Hurricane 3 Volleyball-Shoes for my daughter and she loves them. This her 3rd year in vollyball and now on the varsity team and I wouldn't recommend any other brand other then Mizuno.They arrived in a timely manner. The shoes did arrive in a normal shoe box with all the brand new tags. The fit was on par with other Mizuno brand shoes. We will be buying the same make but maybe a different model as new models come out. Arrived very quickly. These came a day before they were supposed to. They do require going up one size though. My daughter usually wears an eleven in women’s shoes, but she ordered a thirteen so that she could have room to grow. They have good traction but also require breaking into the shoe. Overall, a good price for what you receive. Shoe came in great condition and on time. THE SIZE RUNS SMALL. My daughter has played the whole season in these shoes and loves them. Quality is good and I think they look better than some of the other brands I see on the volleyball floor. Purchased for my daughter. Came in earlier than expected. Perfect fit. Very happy! Initially ordered a size 7 then saw the reviews that they run a little small sent them back and order the 7 1/2 and they fit perfect. Were a bit snug but broke in nicely.",1,1
"Great hard drive with tons of space (7.27TB after formatting). Working great in the media server I built along with two WD Red drives.

"Its hard to find a plus size belt that I like and this looked pretty good, at the moment I have a 38 inch waist but can have a 6 inch diff (depending on what I eat and time of day), this belt will work great for that. I am glad I bought the black and red belt. I got this to wear with my dress for a wedding. I'm a size 18  and the straps are really long, I wrapped it around and made a bow in the front like pictured except I cut off 2 straps and just left one since I thought the 3 together looked to bulky. Great price. Great look.  Perfect for plus size women.  Belt is wide .Look expensive when worn.  Own in black and red.  Highly recommend. More attractive and flattering than I expected. Fits nicely - I'm size 18. I love it.. My only wish was for a leather option :).  Other than that, wonderful product. Ordered to wear with dresses that I have  I like it The lace is very wrinkled and needs to be ironed before it can be worn (which will be challenging as it is attached to a faux leather backing) The size is nice and stays tied. Fits really well and arrived in two days, and it wasn't even on prime! Its such a gorgeous belt!",1,1
"My boyfriend and I recently got into painting via paint-and-sip venues, but we weren't too keen of necessarily spending a lot of money going to one all of the time. We thought we would buy our own canvases, paints and brushes and do our own work. We compared several canvases at different sizes and different prices, but on an impulse, I bought these. With canvases, it's easier to buy them in store when you can feel what you're working with, so this was a slight risk. When the paint hit the canvas, though, I knew the purchase was well worth it. The paint glided against the canvas so perfectly, without any spaces showing, and we used acrylics too! We still have some extra, but when we run out, I will definitely be buying this product again. I was so disappointed with these canvasses,  I bought them for a class I was teaching and wish I would have taken a closer look before using.  (Can get 5 canvasses of the same size and better quality for half the price at Michaels).  There is too much gesso (or something similar) on the canvas so it didn't take the paint as well as it would have if the gesso wasn't used.  Also, three of the five had a huge thick line down the center that is still visible after being painted.  Definitely a bummer. It is always important for me to find the best quality items at the most affordable prices. With that said, this product really met my expectations. These are very nice, primed canvases at a really good price. I am very happy with this purchase and I will be purchasing more in the future. These are ok. You get what you pay for. They are a little warped and were marred up on the edges, but they work for me. I just need something to practice on. I wouldn't recommend for a serious artist though. these are great canvases for the price.  The surface is fairly smooth and the paint adheres beautifully.  I will reorder this purchase. These worked fine for the purpose of amateur artwork and painting.  I was pleased with the quality and they arrived as described. Better quality than I expected, works for beginner painters and probably intermediate.  Was a good deal.  I can't speak to ""advanced"" painters though.  It worked for both watercolor and acrylic (for me). These canvases are fine. Would like the option to buy the deeper canvases that don't need to be framed.",1,1

"I purchased this for my son to wear to his prom. It cost less than renting a vest and tie and my other son might wear it to an upcoming formal. It arrived quickly and my son really liked the light silvery gray color. I ordered the small but it was too big for him. (He is a runner so he is very slender, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34.5"" chest) I contacted the seller and they promptly sent an XS and it fit him perfectly. They even included a return envelope so I could return the small. I was very happy with this purchase and I have recommended this line of products to my friends. The silver vest and neck tie was perfect to add a touch of flair to a traditional suit. It fit my boyfriend very well and there was no adjustments that were needed to be made. He said it fit him comfortably, not too tight with enough breathing room. It made a great contrast with the black and white he wore. I would recommend it for any formal event, it's wonderful. I bought 2 of these for my husband and his best man to wear under darker gray suits for our wedding and they both looked great. I was worried they might look a little cheap because of the price and the amount of shine in the photo, but they were easily on par with anything we would have gotten at Mens Warehouse and the shine wasn't an issue at all in our wedding photos. Ordered this for our wedding. It definitely runs large. But, there is a buckle on the back you can cinch it up. Overall, it is a really nice looking vest. Came fast and worked well for it's purpose. This vest was absolutely perfect for my son's prom.  It cost less money than renting a vest and tie would have.  My son looked so much nicer than the boys who had rented theirs.  I was so pleased with it that I ordered another color for his next prom.  It exceeded my expectations!  Delivery was even speedy too. I was a bit worried when I purchased these prom accessories so cheaply, but was pleasantly surprised at how great they looked. I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered the large for my 6'7"", 250lb son. The XL that he normally wears would have been too big. So, yes, the product fit great because I sized down. It looked notably better on the web site.  The stitching is basic and the long stitches are visible at some angles; the back is also only adjustable by an inch or two, making even the Small too large to fit me proportionately.  That said, it is the cheapest vest I could find on Amazon.",1,1

"I was so excited about all the good reviews. I ordered the black one, which is supposed to be matte and black interior, I got a shiny black instead, with a red interior and unfinished seams. The buckle was also different than pictured and was already rusting. Overall the bag was terrible quality. See pics. I thought this was going to be a tad roomier; however, that is my fault for not reading the description thoroughly. I still love it though. I took a chance getting purple because usually go with Browns and gray, but I love the color and I'm glad I did. Im thinking about ordering the color gray since it's so cheap. It fits my iPhone 6s Plus perfectly, and I managed to also put my money, debit card, subway card, Chapstick, extra sugar packets and some mints in this too but I'm already about the limit. I think if it had a pocket on the outside for money or something it would be even more perfect, but really, the price is so amazing, I can live without the extra pocket. I used it for the first time today. It's just what I wanted. It holds my iPhone 6 plus nicely and it has a second pocket for money, credit card and sunglasses.  I just wanted a small purse for when I'm shopping and doing a lot of walking. It's.very light weight. love love love it came SUPPPEER quick and is the perfect length for me (5'1) exactly like the picture very cute An excellent case to protect and carry your cell phone,the cases name is correct! The case fells like quality glove leather and the metal clips on the caring strap is also made with quality materials. The case is securely locks with push button locking closure to ensure your cell phone doesn't accidently slip out. Your credit cards, checks and cash are also securely enclosed in a special pocket. A third pocket is also inside the case for you to carry other valuables such as a passport or other thing for travel or other needs. The carry strap is long enough for a tall person or to stole the case under your clothing, Perfect for what I wanted.  I have a new phone and wanted to protect it.  This works as a purse as well,  Love it. It actually fits into my handbag as well, so when the phone rings, I can easily reach for the mini handbag and have access to my phone without having to search for the phone at the bottom of my handbag.  This little purse is very handy.  The only reason for one less star is the pink color is off, not quite as pictured.  I ordered the red as well and think I will be happier with that color, which will match the lining of my handbag.  Oh, also, it is very well made, looks much more expensive, very attractive and looks like it will last a long time. Super impressed with the quality of this item - for $10 I was worried that it would look cheap and be poorly made - This two pouch phone purse/ case is adorable. It holds my 6+ phone and has room for cards/ license and keys. Long shoulder strap makes diagonal shoulder purse so easy and comfortable. Love it.",1,1
"Bought two of these to go on my wife and mine night stands. Now our room is like a runway with LED lights bright enough to land a small plane. Not all that bad though, because they do charge our S7 Edge phones pretty fast and when we get bored we can do shadow puppets on our walls. After doing a lot of research and reading about the amount of faked Samsung chargers, I specifically ordered one directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller. Not that Amazon itself wouldn't have already sold  products by mistake as well (such as phone batteries according to the German magazine c't) but I guess the chances in getting a genuine product are way higher with Amazon in this case. This degress is necessary as I think most people who rate the Samsung charger not that great, most probably got nailed and received a fake. First I want to let you know I have both the regular charging pad and this Fast charging pad.  They both work fine, but this one really charges up your phone fast.  It lights up different colors to mean different things.  Easy to use charging pad.  I purchased the normal charging pad first before knowing there was a fast charger model.  So I use the normal charging pad in on the night stand for night charging.  If I need my phone charged up Fast I use this Fast charging pad in the kitchen.  I get home from work and drop it on the fast charger.  Later use the phone around the house, then when I go to get I place it on the normal charging pad.  If I only had money for one, get this Fast charging pad.  Hope this helps you decide. If you are thinking the price is too high, let me tell you...I returned another highly rated product at 1/3+ the cost that I purchased before this one.  Let me tell you why this is worth the money: 1. It is rapid charging, 2. It comes with the BLACK brick (rapid charging and black cord)  so you don't have to buy one or use the one that came with your phone, 3  the back of your phone stays cool--the lesser expensive one got my phone really hot, 4. It is adjustable.  It can be upright or down and I personally like to see my phone and grab to answer calls, 5.  It is amazingly beautiful with leather pad look, 6.  it is very stable, with a grip pad to keep it from sliding and sturdy enough to securely hold my Galaxy S8 phone --an $800 investment.  I liked it so much I'm giving my son one just like it.  There's not a better option .  You will like it for certain if you can get over the price.  It's worth it. Pros: Compact design, good rubber-like backing keeps the phone from sliding off, charges my phone quickly, comes with cord and quick-charge plug (some competing products require those be purchased separately, so factor in that cost if comparing).",1,1
"I really LOVE this belt!! It cost more than most belts I've bought but it is worth it. The problem I've had with previous belts is they are not 100% leather and eventually split at hole where the buckle fits. Although this belt was a little longer than I expected, this actually became a huge plus!! When I put the belt on, there were only 2 holes left to make the belt tighter. Since I am trying to lose weight, this limited how long the belt would fit if my waist size got smaller. Also, I noticed there was too much belt left on the end that would stick out because the belt was too long.  So I followed the instructions to remove some length from the belt using the tool they provided and NOW it fit perfectly!! By shortening the belt, now I had 5 holes that could be used as my waste size shrinks! My only complaint is the belt material is so STRONG that it was impossible for me to make a hole using the punch hole tool kit. I was afraid of hammering my thumb if I missed hitting the punch tool and so couldn't hit the hammer hard enough to cut a hole. I eventually had to use an electric drill to make the hole. I therefore gave it a 4 star. But because I have an electric drill I could make the hole and now have a PERFECT belt... I LOVE this belt... Great quality, definitely recommend a full grain leather belt. ""Genuine"" leather is orders of magnitude lower quality than this, and this is about a quarter of the price of what I saw ""genuine"" leather belts going for at Joseph. A Banks. Full grain leather is not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed so if the cow the leather is from had a scar your belt will to which is pretty metal. If you don't like that you should go for top grain leather which is sanded, buffed, and snuffed or split grain leather (suede). ""Genuine leather [is] made of several layers of low quality leather bonded together with glue and then painted to look like a better-quality leather. It's what is left over when the other, higher grades are stripped away."" Genuine might make it sound good, but you definitely want to go for full grain, top grain, or split grain if you want something leather. I REALLY love how thick this leather is and how nice it feels. There's no stitching at all except to hold in the metal loop, so I know that it'll last for a really long time. The only thing I'm docking a star for is because I've only worn it a few times and it has already formed a pretty defined crease. I'm not sure if that's due to it being all leather, or maybe I'm wearing too big of pants or too heavy from tools or something? I don't know. But It's happened and it worries me a little. Great belt, top grain quality leather but NOT for dress pants.  Belt it 1.5 inch thick which I believe is too wide for dress pants. This is a great quality leather belt.  I've been very pleasantly suprised how its held up over the past 5 months.  The leather itself is actual real leather, which is unheard of for the this price.  If you're a 35-36ish waist like me you'll find the 36-39 to be the right belt but you'll need to trim it down, which they include instructions on how to do.  I'll probably buy more shades of this belt just because of the high quality of the first one I bought. I was expecting something average, this is a great value. If I were the manufacturer, I'd include a small tutorial on how to care for the belt in the future. The quality is such that you'll want to give the customer every chance to care for this. The tool kit is a nice bonus and the gift box is a nice touch. Just out of college fifty years ago, I obtained a black, rawhide belt maybe an 1 1/4"" wide. It's been my ""go to"" belt ever since. I still use it for working around the house. Early indications are that this Pazaro belt may continue that proud tradition. It seems pliable but tough and durable. I would purchase one again and do recommend it! This belt is everything a leather belt (as opposed to leather covered material labeled as leather) should be; tough, soft, good looking, well made. One note, I don't understand why they ask size since they have no size on the belt. I needed a 38 and it was probably a 44. It is easy to shorten and comes with an excellent punch, but non-handy people may not appreciate the bother.",1,1
"This is exactly shat I needed!  I can fit my camera, attachments, tripods and cleaning products for my camera and still have room for my camcorder.  Exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered it.  It's smaller than my husbands camera bag but  this bag fits everything and more for me.  The little compartments can change to fit what you need it to by moving the arms and securing them to the sides with Velcro.  There's a good sized pocket in front to keep less bulky items and there is also a zipped pocket on the side.  The side pocket also is attacked to velcro .  if you pull it loose and fold it down you will find another pouch hidden behind the zippered pocket.  Inside there is more storage on the top.  Perfect for all my little goodies! I was looking for a separate bag for my Canon 70d with 70-200 and 24-105 lenses and came across this bag.  I liked the reviews so I purchased it and I'm glad I did.  My favorite gear fits perfectly in this light, compact bag with plenty of storage for accessories.  It's easy to grab it and go without having to switch bags because my other was full of lenses.  It's supposed to be waterproof but I haven't tested it for that and hope I never have to.  You can sort the inside any way you want to to fit your needs.  I'm very happy with this bag and look forward to using it when I go on weekend trips and extended vacations. At first I thought it was a little small - but my daughter has the Sony A7sii with the 4 Rokinon cinematic lenses, and she would tend to carry the camera around her neck on a shoot moving location to location since it was too big a hassle to put the Sony lens back on so the camera would fit in the hardshell case. Rokinon back in it's case, etc. Great bag if you want to carry a full/compact frame digital SLR with a few extra lenses.  The zipper seems high quality, the padding is thick and supportive, many are adjustable with velcro, and the pockets are just right for flatter items like an iPad, cables, and thin charger.  Just take note, if you run an attached battery grip on your camera body, this bag is too shallow for it to fit while attached and sit in the pocket zippered up (I have to remove my battery grip to store the SLR body and zipper shut the bag). Great lightweight camera bag for the price. I ordered the ""large"" looking for more space, and I would still definitely call this large ""a medium/small"" backpack. So be advised if you do decide to order the smaller sizes, the LARGE is still pretty small. Wouldn't fit a larger laptop like it insinuates. We have 3 camera's with accessories. It was a pain carrying all that equipment and a tripod. We were able to put everything safely into this backpack without having to cram it in. We have expensive professional equipment with large telephoto lenses and it all fits in nicely. It has surrounding thick cushions for protection. It's comfortable to wear and lightweight. I wish we would have had this year's ago. It's made carrying our equipment much easier without worry. Would highly recommend this camera case. I've been waiting for a while to invest in a camera bag. As I grow in my hobby, I've accumulated more and more lenses and cameras and this bag was perfect. It's sturdy, very adjustable, feels like high quality stuff. This also felt very good on my back. It didn't make it sore, or achy, it was just right. Never mind the great price, this is an ideal bag for anyone. I have just started back taking a lot of photos and need to corral my equipment in one place for travel. I shopped many other back pack solutions and this product had the features I needed at a very good price.  Very adaptable to customization, lots of compartments that protect your equipment.  Very happy and would recommend it.  I think of it as a great travel bag and less as a bag for hiking in the back country.  I don’t do that so this bag is fine for me.  For a hiking bag I would want more flaps that let you get to your equipment without opening the main flap/ cover.  Bags that have those features cost much more.  This one perfect for me",1,1
"OMG- Look just like Chanel for a penny of the price! Got some many compliments and questions. Perfect for women and men! I feel like the man when I wear these. They on point I like them i can pull your girl plus your grandma with these on They are great frames. Decent enough with only a slight flaw in the lenses. They had a weird filmy rainbow streaking across but nothing noticeable when looking through them. No big deal since I'm using them for a costume I'm currently working on. I just got mine today and I really like them a lot thinking bout getting some more but one of the handle broke I had to use super glue on them holds pretty well just wish the made them alitte wider and stronger handles for the ear. Very well made for the price and great looking with just about anything i wear...they look more expensive than what I paid I was so excited about wearing these glasses. Let me just say that they are absolutely amazing. I have worn them only once, but can't wait to wear them again. They fit perfectly and they complimented my outfit. I feel like a sophisticated lady when I wear these!",1,1
"This was purchased as a gift for my wife... under the assumption it would be used for wires and cables and other electronic stuff. I travel on business quite a bit and need to take various electronics with me (I also repair hardware servers) and over the years my laptop bag has become a jumble of various bits and pieces that I need. I finally decided after this last trip to Africa I had to get better organized. So I purchased this roll-up case as one of the three possible solutions (which means I also bought two other cases of different styles). I like this case as it hold a bunch of stuff securely and rolls up into a neat package. I also put my Tile bluetooth tracker in it so it also serves a purpose for finding my bag if I get disconnected from it. All in all a neat bag that has good quality construction and I can recommend this if you're looking to neaten up your electronics. Very good value. We travel with a lot of devices and the cords are usually a mess in the backpack. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. It has a pocket and belt for just about everything. My only regret is that I should have purchased this earlier. Keeps cords and batteries well organized. Highly recommend this product I finally had the opportunity to test drive this bag on a short driving trip last weekend. A major drawback to it, in my opinion, is it is a tad too small to deal with the Apple laptop cord (the white square and the power cord combo.) I can get it zipped up but it is a real struggle trying to get the power cord in a pocket. With the power cord and square in there, plus a portable Bluetooth mouse it does not lay flat as shown in the Amazon photo. See my photos. This is for small electronics' cords - phones and tablets. Thumbdrive pockets would probably hold but I would use the zippered pockets for thumbdrives. If you're like most poeple, you have a lot of devices and wires to charge them. If you're like me, you're always losing them or have them break in your bag. UPDATE AGAIN: After the company read my review they contacted me, asked me for some details, and then provided a new roll-up. I certainly would give this company 5 Stars, and if this one doesn't separate as the earlier one did, I will come back here and upgrade my review. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I can add/subtract stuff and it gets thicker or thinner.  I love that it isn't some zippered thing that may or may not result in the zipper breaking if it's too full of stuff.",1,1

"I ate these at home, not on the go, but it felt like they'd be very good for eating while walking around or skateboarding... whatever it is that kids do these days while eating applesauce one-handed. Kids love it.  Great for a meal sidedish or on the road.  Easy to open, easy to eat, easy to clean up. My little one loves these.  They are a great healthy snack for her. Great go to. Often carry in purse. Have vegetable drawer in frig full at all times...vegetable versions, applesauce and yougart ones also. Have low blood sugar problem.  My fault. I get busy and don't take time to eat Original advertisement as 6 cases of 12 for a total of 72. Only shipped one box of 12. Consistently good product.  My kids love these. My kids love GoGo squeeZ.  Great for on the go or in the lunchbox!  They're not in this variety pack but my son has fallen in love with their pumpkin spice flavor.  I need to stock up as its limited edition! Great neat pack along snack! My kids all love it!",1,1
"I loved it, it was everything that I had imagined, the size was exactly what I wanted. Thanks Amazon.",1,0
The product itself has a good quality for the price but the packaging is so disappointing. The item arrived crushed. I want to purchase again (5pcs) but is it possible to put it in a box to avoid crushing the item when handled by the courier. Thank you.,-1,-1
"This belt is very cute. I think it must be made for girls though, not women. My 7 year old is not overweight at all and it fit her perfectly. Based on the other reviews saying it was very small for a women's belt I went for it because the price was so good. For a girls belt it is great. The butterfly is rather large to get through regular belt loops so keep that in mind. The shirt I intended it to go with came with different extra wide belt so I knew it would fit. it stretched out after only wearing for a few hours not happy oh well! I have a 25 inch waist and this is a little snug (not uncomfortable though) so I wouldn't count too much on the stretch if your waist is any bigger. It does look cute though and you really don't see it on the picture but the band has some glitter, enough to be cute not tacky. Not good don't buy it Fits pretty snugly - I wore it while dancing and it popped off.  The clasp is very small and doesn't hold it on tightly enough.  Looked cute, average quality.  The belt itself is awesome but the buckle hook is not angled to have a grip to hold the belt Matched my silver dress for wedding perfectly!  Fit just right.  No complaints!  It was nicer in person then picture! Nice belt, would've like for the material to be it to be a little thicker.",1,1

"This camera bag is just the right size for our Nikon camera L830.  The camera fits snug so as to keep it from being damaged, yet it is big enough to let me get to the camera easily and the other pockets les me carry my extra batteries. I use this to carry my Olympus OM-D E-M10 and two lenses, the M.Zuiko 14-42 mm and M.Zuiko 17mm f/2.8. Keep in mind that lenses for mirror-less 4/3 cameras are much smaller than DSLR lenses. I'm maxed out of space now but it makes for pleasant carrying size/weight - everything in the pic fits in this bag nicely but that's pretty much all I can fit in it. This is a great bag for point and shoot cameras and there is plenty of room for SD cards and a power/USB cord. Nice and sturdy material. Recommended! Small bag which is great for a micro 4/3rds camera and a couple lenses.  It is almost the same size as a small Case Logic bag (I think it's the Case Logic DCB-304), but this one a bit more usable space, and the option of using the buckle on the flap vs. zipping it shut.  Inside it I can fit my OM-D E-M10 mark ii with Olympus 25mm f/1.8 attached, the Oly 40-150, the Panasonic 12-32mm, the Olympus 9mm body-cap lens, and two extra batteries. It's pretty tight with the OMD due to the EVF's bump on top of the camera, but it works.  Normally the bag just holds the lenses while the camera is around my neck anyway. I was looking for a bag for Sony Alpha a6000 kit with two lenses, and this is just it. If you want to carry around everything including chargers, filters, more lenses etc, you'd need something bigger, but this bag is perfect for just the camera with 16-55mm on, additional 55-200mm lens and spare battery. Besides, excellent quality. This is a small bag, make no mistake about it. I love compact, but I was a little disappointed about the size (think length and height of an iPad min... width about 3/4 length of a mini). I purchased this for my daughter who is going on a trip this summer and needed something to put a Canon Sx170IS in along with all the extras she would need. This case fits the camera very easily, this actually be a bit big for a small point and shoot, but thats what I wanted because it also holds  In fairness the description does say ""compact"" DSL/DSLR camera case. I looked at the measurements and it seemed like it would be ok, but apparently my Cannon Rebel T6 is not ""compact"" and was not the right size (w/ stock lens). If you worked at it, it would fit, but that's it... no room left over... well, maybe for an extra SD card. Bag seems of good quality, but I returned it same day, so cannot comment beyond my initial impression. This is a wonderful case for a very low price.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is simple.  Since I didn't go to the store to purchase this camera bag I didn't know exactly how it was laid out.  I had to go by the description that was given.  It has my camera listed and my camera does fit inside, but with the camera in the bag there isn't any room for anything else.  The bag comes with a divider that can be moved and velcro'ed into place anywhere inside the bag, a nice feature to keep your camera secure and separate from other things (like sd cards and extra batteries). with my Kodak camera inside the case there isn't enough room for the divider itself, little lone an extra battery.  There is a small zippered holder inside the lid that will hold a some battery's though.  The case is exactly what they say it is and will tightly hold your camera safely inside. Just don't plan on being able to carry along a charger or many batteries to get you through a extended trip.",1,1
Looks good in real too,1,-1
"Like many of the reviews, not the right color. Was much more blue than shown in the picture, rather than aqua. If you want that aqua color, do not buy this. If you want a pretty tie at a great price that is solid quality and color doesn't matter, then go ahead and get this tie. Nice ties, but the color shown is not a true representation. The aqua in the picture ends up being a much lighter and truer blue color. Having to return all 11 I ordered for our upcoming wedding. Glad there's still plenty of time to make this wrong, right. The quality is good but the color was not ""aqua"" at all compared to the picture. came just in time ! Loved how it looked on my boyfriend",1,1
Very poor product quality. Very poor service by seller. Item received is totally different from what is being posted yet seller claimed that they are the same.,-1,-1
"I bought these in a size 6 and I have wide feet. I wear a 6 to a 6.5 depending on the style/type of shoes. These fit perfectly! THEY BROKE THE FIRST DAY I USED THEM!!! Cute shoes, but way too big.... HUGE!! I love these shoes. Because of back issues, I am unable to wear shoes with any kind of heel but these are so cute that I decided to give them a try. They are character (ballroom) shoes so the arch support is spot on. The fit is amazing and the quality is better than I expected for the price. I bought these for work because I have to wear closed-toe shoes. I have a tough size, 10.5 wide, so I'm always wary of buying shoes on the internet. I took a chance after some of my old shoes had finally broken, and I'm so glad I did. These shoes fit perfect! They are comfy, the toe box is not too tight, and I don't get blisters on my heels after walking all day in them. This was a great purchase that I would gladly buy again when I need a new pair! Great shoes for the price and so comfortable that I went dancing in them and did not need to take them off or stop dancing because of pain. No blisters either even though I did not wear stockings. I'm between 6.5 and 7 and bought the 6.5 and they fit well...even slightly loose. Amazon is only letting me write one review but I bought the baby pink (Rose) and salmon (Coral) as in the photos (which Amazon turned). Love them!! Thank you seller :) they were delivered pretty fast and they were package pretty nice, very happy with this order, they look amazing with skinny jeans! I am always size 7 and this shoes fit perfect. Love these shoes! I plan to get them in more colors!",1,1

"Ring was comfortable however It only lasted 5 days before it tore. Excellent, affordable rings. Great for those who work with their hands. No fear of ring avulsion (if you haven't heard of this affliction, a google image search will scare the heck out of you). I very rarely leave reviews but had to share my experience regarding this purchase. I ordered these because I am an avid gym rat and my wedding band is uncomfortable to lift in. Read reviews about these type of rings and figured I’d give it a try. I received my rings on time and the correct size that I ordered. Unfortunately, the ring fit a little more snug than my true ring size and wasn’t very comfortable. Swagmat, Ltd. contacted me to see if I was happy with my purchase. I told them that I was however the rings did not fit perfectly. To fix the situation (and completely from their recommendation as I didn’t ask for anything) they offered to send me 2 more 3-packs of the rings, each 1/2 size bigger than I originally ordered free of charge. And asked me to keep the original rings in case I may potentially need them in the future. I understand that the rings aren’t very expense, however this is the definition of exceptional customer service. I would highly recommend doing business with Swagmat. The product is great and the customer service is second to none! Silicone rings arrived on time, all three were sealed in a clear pouch.  Packaging was simple and something you would expect from a warehouse.  I bought this to give my husband as a give and the packaging looked a bit cheap. The silicone rings fit true to size and are easy to get on and off.  I would purchase the product again and recommend. I thought I purchased Swagmat rings but apparently I purchased them from seller ""Magic-life"" and they are not Swagmat rings. (They don't have the Swagmat logo or ring size embossed on the inside and they came in a plain ziploc bag rather than a Swagmat-branded bag.) Pros: I have been wearing them for three weeks and they are very comfortable. They don't dig into my pinky causing sores like my gold wedding band did. Also, I bought size 11 and they are true to size. Cons: The colors are advertised as black, dark gray and light gray, and I bought them specifically for the dark gray color. What I actually got was black, medium gray, and almost white. Also, all three rings are not symmetrical. They are perfectly round, but when looking at the rings when on my finger the top half and the bottom half have different tapers. I hope that makes sense. In short, I can't speak to the quality of Swagmat's rings, but if you are ordering these based on the product description then I would make sure to choose Swagmat as the seller and not someone else like I did without even realizing it. My husband has big hand which swell often.  He is hardly ever able to wear his wedding band.  I happened to see these and thought what the heck let's see is he likes them.  HE DOES!  These rings have some stretch to them so even when his hands swell he can wear them and they aren't uncomfortable.  He even recommended them to one of his co-workers.  I bought myself some of the pretty girly ones too :) Certainly a good value here. From a functionality standpoint, the rings fit true to size and are very comfortable. Not much in the way of style but does have a nice matte finish. Not really going to fool anyone into thinking these are metal rings, but who cares. In the past we purchased rings from a different buyer and they didn't fit my husband well. After a short time they stretched out. So we ordered these and they are great! My husband really likes the fit and the width of the rings.",1,1
"Beautiful! Really lovely for the price. Looks good. I’d have given five stars except that the stones are set as such that their bottom points are exposed through the band and touch the skin on my finger. Isn’t a huge deal, but I can see how that would come to be slightly uncomfortable. I love this ring, it is so beautiful and more impressive in person than the picture shows, It's beautiful, exactly as described. Sparkly and feminine, yet a wide setting, exactly what I wanted.  If the design suits your taste, you can't go wrong! This ring is exactly, if not better, than what was shown. It came quickly and was the perfect size. My favorite ring ever! Love this ring! The ring is elegant. Glad I purchased it. No regrets. Wow! I am so impressed by this ring. It’s actually nicer than the photos. The stones are nice sized and beautifully proportioned. It actually looks like white gold/diamond. I certainly won’t correct anyone if they ask. Great ring for the value. Very impressed. Beautiful band!!",1,1
"Very nice!!! Quality of the swimsuit is good. Should have gotten a slightly larger size rather than the M. Seems to have a slight defect, but then again, it looked like it was meant to be there. 😂 Oh, it also comes with inner bra padding. 👍🏼 Awesome swimwear. Received lots of compliments. Great item and satisfactory quality. Item received as per what we sees on the picture.

The perfume in this still gives it a toxic rating. Was looking for something chemical free. Very disappointed. Left my hair soft & shiny. Loved it!! I really like the conditioner it leaves my hair smooth.the shampoo is not as good as I expected. I have really thick curly hair. no problems Love this! I love this combination.  The conditioner leaves your hair very soft and easy to detangle. My grandson swears by it! Has a wonderful smell and leaves hair feeling great.,1,1

"Had inital technical issues with my wallet. They called to provide support, which I appreciate. The wallet is functioning well now.   Product also came in sealed form with no tampering. Order item on Thursday afternoon and item was shipped out the same day. Fast delivery and received on Saturday afternoon. Item received seal and in good conditions. +++ for Seller. As an avid cryptocurrency investor, this hardware wallet is amazing for keeping Bitcoins, Ethereum and Litecoin. When paired with MyEtherWallet, you can keep other altcoins such as REQ, OMG and TRX. Thank you for packaging the product so well too! Though there were some issues about the delivery due to the crazy market, the seller made the best effort to fulfill the order. Appreciated. Only initialization setup once plugged in. Rather straightforward to use and secure the wallets. Some keychain, cord accessories included in the package, very good.",1,1
"It fit perfectly into the hard drive tray for the ps3. It arrived quickly, well-wrapped and protected. It works perfectly after setup, And for those of you wondering the easiest way to start up the PS3 with a new hard drive, I can help. THIS IS NOT A NEW HARD DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!!! It is used with 120 bad blocks on HDD after I tested it, Charging a couple dollars less for a used hard drive is not only unethical its a straight up scam. Not only that after doing a scan on the hard drive you can see that there are still pictures and documents that are recoverable from the drive. Selling a drive on a mass market by formatting the data off of a windows computer and then selling it to strangers is not only dangerous, but it leads people to be vulnerable to identity theft. Purchased this drive to replace my 150GB Playstation 3 hard drive, because I finally got to connect my PS3 to be able to download games off the PS Store! This hard drive came exactly as stated. However, when I purchased it, I couldn't tell if it was a brand new product, or a refurbished one. When I installed it, it definitely seemed like a refurbished one, because there seemed to be some data already on it. The PS3 formatted it, so I have no clue what that data was (since I did not have a way to read the drive outside of the PS3). So, take note that this is most likely a refurbished hard drive. Western digital is a brand you can trust, I feel it faster than the stock ps4 hd. It's less noisy. The process to update and install is fairly easy, be sure to backup your saved data on the cloud or a USB flash drive. Might take awhile to download all your apps but hey it's worth it in the end. Also available is a 1TB hardrive which is the next upgrade because I keep adding games to my collection. Look up videos on YouTube how to set it up if you need help. This was perfect. After reading other buyers' comments, I chose this drive for my daughters PS3 super slim unit.  Flawless transaction.  Bought it on a friday, received it on a sunday!  Requested 2nd day shipping.  Again, flawless installation except for the part of unscrewing the casing from the original hard drive.  One screw was quite stubborn.  I would recommend buying additional screws in case you end up stripping the ones on the old drive.  Or, remove them first so you know if you actually need to buy more.  Drive slipped into the slot perfectly.  And I mean perfectly!  My daughter had the software installed within 10 minutes.  (If you see a couple reviews from me regarding this item, I filled out 3, but no idea what the others were for, so please forgive me if you see all of them.  They say the same thing.) HDD in my dvr went bad and I picked up the cheapest new 500gb hdd I could find at amazon, paid $38 and got a Western Digital Caviar black.  Not mad at all, in fact, the hdd is now inside my pc serving as my second gaming drive and migrated some of the games like BF1 and GTA V which both installed were ~140gb.  Works like a charm.",1,1
Good deal :),1,1
"I just got these today and they were exactly what I was looking for. They are lightweight without being too thin. Almost my entire house is hardwood or tile, and I use these on my swiffer mops in place of the expensive wet cloths. I throw some in a bucket with warm water and lysol, ring out and just toss in a pile to be washed as I go along. Always a clean cloth without spending a bunch to keep my house clean with three boys living here! I hope these last a while because they are doing a great job cleaning today! Very nice towel, gave these to my son for Christmas and he has already used them for cleaning his truck. He says they work wonderful and got the dust and grime off his dash and windows,. Great towels, I would have preferred they would be a little larger for what I was going to use them.  The towels are good quality and have been staying together through several uses just fine - they clean up nicely too after the job is finished. What a deal, what a steal!  I now have a stack of these next to my kitchen sink. Use these to clean up around the store, does not leave a piece of lint behind.  Seems like good quality. A huge pack and good sized. They are also soft enough to use as wash clothes. These are great! I keep a bunch in my new car and it helps to clean the interior or exterior whenever you want. Also very practical for a lot of other applications. Very soft and quality material for such a great price. Highly recommended! I purchased these to detail our vehicles interior.  They are just the right size for my small hands.  They washed up nicely.  I'm going to start using them in my house cleaning activities also. Very happy.",1,1
"I love how easy it is to use!  This is the second G-Drive I have purchased. Set up is very easy.  I have an apple computer, one G- drive I use for my  backup, and one drive I use strictly for photo's. The G- drive works well with the mac time machine.  I take a lot of photos and put them on this portable drive,  since I don't want to fill up my computer disk space.  I  travel around the US and spend a lot of time on planes. It is easy to take this drive out while on the flight and edit my photo's, and back up Lightroom.  I love the fact that I only need to plug in the USB connector cable that comes with the drive, no need for an electric outlet. The drive is fast and  quite, no fan noise.  I find the thin size also perfect for being on the run and packing into small bags.  The case is rugged, and I don't have any worries of it breaking. The port is also sturdy and the cord plugs easily in place.  I have purchase many other drive brands and this by far is my favorite. G-drives have always worked perfectly before.  Not this 4TB drive. This is my second drive by this company. As a television editor, this is a saver. LOVE IT!  I tried a W Drive, but it comes with some funky software and my iMac rarely recognized it...so replaced the W Drive with this GTECH and it hasn't missed a beat yet!  Yea!!! Works fast and easy for iMac.  Works faster and more easily than My Passport for Mac, my other backup. Passport generates odd and misleading error messages. G simply works without the faulty hardware and software of Passport. Drive works just fine, but the case itself is a bit fragile compared to my previously purchased G-tech devices. Twisting the case slightly in your hand causes the top to separate. Plastic tabs hold the front to the frame, and I wonder if over time the front will eventually pop off entirely. The drive inside works fine as always. Nice size for portable applications and much cheaper than buying two 1TB drives. I have another hard drive from G-Technology and am quite satisfied. Seems fine- Use it for my Imac time machine backup. Of course , I won't really know until my next computer catastrophe.",1,1

"This works great and I can hear the other person and they can hear me. Works great, clear reception on an old Panasonic phone. I only received it about a week ago, it took 3 weeks to arrive so have only used it for a short time. So far it is good although I still hear some background noise, I thought it was supposed to eliminate all background noise............ Works great Did not work with Panasonic KX-DT343 phone model, sounds comes in so far away. Nice head set. Not too snug. Ear pads pivot slightly for comfort. Leatherette not foam, I hate the foam. Cord seems heavy duty but short. I bought a two foot extention for 2.5 jack on the side of Polycom SoundPoint 331 IP phone, my company requires we use this phone. Headset has inline control for volume and mute, but no light to tell you when the mute is on. Also a clip to attach to clothes, I would deduct a half point for the no mute indicator light if I could. First non Plantronics headset I have had in a while. For the money, $42, a good buy and arrived in two days with Amazon Prime. I work from home making outbound calls and refuse to use the phone hand set all day. Now I just hit the heaset button on the phone and dial. To hang up I do the same. I have used it for a week and so far so good. If you have a 2.5 jack on your phone or cordless handset this wil work for you. Also works with an 3.5 jack adaptor on my cell phone, Note 8 or tablets They're perfect with my Panasonic phone,the quality of Arama seems to be very high,this is great buy, the price is reasonable.",1,1

"I've never gotten so many compliments on a pair of shoes before. Takes about a week to get broken into (longer than other shoes in my experience) but as comfortable as an average sneaker after. Pretty waterproof as well It has a problem, is a little problem but I pay for a good condition shoes , and I would like solve this situation For the cost of the shoe, I don't think you can beat it.  I don't plan on wearing these every day so im assuming the wear and tear on these will be more minimal compared to others.  Its a very lightweight shoe with a some what thinner sole so I would say anyone who plans on wearing these several days throughout the week would see this shoe start to fall apart after a several months.  After just a day of wearing them, they seemed to break in pretty good but the leather is extremely stiff and a little more difficult to get on if you tie the laces tighter like I did. Fits generally well. Might have gone one up but I can deal with the size I purchased. The style I really enjoy, and it’s shinier than I expected. It squeaks a lot and make a lot of noise. It does not have any ventilation nice shoes but disappointed that they are not leather. good looking & comfortable shoe for the price, though. The leather is hard and will time to break in other than that the quality is good and the fit is right on Nice shoe, but the size was one inch bigger than what I usually wear.",1,1
"I gave up powered golf carts for good and now I walk every round I play. My Callaway shoes with the PINS spikes worked fine from a powered cart but for walking they hurt like mad despite being worn enough to have to replace the spikes this season. The only golf shoes that fits me perfectly and are water repellent for a long time.  Design and quality are superb. wow.....these are the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever worn (they feel like moccasins!).....also, the most expensive!! So.....do I think they are worth the extra money?  Yes.........I don't need distractions on the golf course from shoes...there's enough to complain about in golf already!!!  I just hope they are durable and last a long time.....my foot joys lasted a couple seasons....my callaways wore out quicker so I'm hoping to get two seasons from these. I absolutely love these shoes.  They're my 3rd pair of Bioms.  I wear a sz. 12 W and the size 46 fits  me like a glove.  At the beginning of the day when I first put them on they feel snug all around.  But the supple yak leather quickly expands so that they really do feel like a glove after a hole or two.  I buy a pair every year.  If you watch these shoes they often go on sale, I've never paid over $100 for them but I wouldn't feel cheated paying full price.  Great shoes! Without a doubt the most comfortable golf shoes I've ever worn. The grip on the soles is great, no slippage whatsoever. Great style, light weight. Can't hardly feel them when I wear them. My second pair of Ecco Biom Hybrids.  I find them the best golf show I have ever worn, and I have worn a few different brands and models.  I would not buy another type of golf shoe.  Period. This is my second pair of Ecco's and I love them.  Good arch support and they hold up.  I'm a woman and need the men's sizes because they don't make my size in women's. I have had several pairs of these golf shoes.  They are comfortable from the first wearing.  The uppers wear well, but the cleats wear out with time and heavy use.",1,1

"LovEEEE the bright colors. I read the reviews before ordering and I went a size up and it fit my son perfectly!! This is really a great quality shirt! I ordered a Large for my 6 year old. A medium would have fit better, but I like to order things one size up because kids grow so fast. Very happy with this purchase. Will be ordering another for my other son as well. My 5 year old's elementary had an ""All abilities"" week in support of students with disabilities. Each day was a different color and Friday was the rainbow. This shirt fits my guy a little big but will grow into it. Cute shirt!! i would have liked it to be a little softer. but it fit as expected and the quality is similar to what you might find at an AC Moore or Michaels I bought this shirt for my daughter's tie dye day at school. It fits great, vibrant colors, and washes well too. No complaints here. My son loves this shirt so much! Nice fit, great colors even after washing many times. Best shirt for ""Rainbow Day"" at school & every few days ever since. My 6-year-old loves this shirt! It looks great & fits well. We ordered a Medium & there's a little room to grow, but that's how we like shirts so we can wear the shirts for a little while.",1,1
"The only reason I have given a 3 star ration is due to the product not getting delivered as per the schedule. However, on contact Lazada it was promptly acted upon and the product delivered within the next 2 days. Value for money and your living room isn't large. Picture quality is great enough for me as I don't subscribe programs to watch movies. No indicator light to tell whether TV is turned on or off. Bad! Unlike Andriod-based TV, there ain't much useful apps available for download. Fast Delivery. Bought a Samsung 40"" TV and arrived in 2 days. But will be better if can attached the receipt together with the TV Good resolution and plenty of features and the delivery was much faster than expected overall a good buy! Great value for a brand new smart TV.  Delivery time was not provided and I had to call ninjavan to fix timing. Overall, still worth the effort.",1,1
"Size is prefect my son is almost seven and typically wears size seven I got it a little big since we are going to Disney in a few months and he may grow. Cute graphic especially for a kid who is not quite into mickey mouse. My 11 year old son loved this shirt for WDW. It has a space theme, which he loves so doesn't feel it is too babyish. He wears it on any day, not just to visit WDW. My son loved this shirt for our trip to Disney World. I like that it is Disney without being too Disney, if you know what I mean. He could wear this on a daily basis and it still looks like a cool shirt. It did not shrink after washing. My son LOVES Mickey Mouse and space.  What a perfect combination.  This shirt fits well, wears well and keeps well with repeated washings. Only critique is that the glow in the dark portion is only Mickey's ""head"" I thought the background would glow too. Excellent shirt! Nice screenprinting and heavy feel to the shirt. Great quality. Very fun shirt for my little guy who loves space and Mickey! I love, love, love this design and it came quickly. It does run a bit small though so here's hoping it still fits my son for our trip in a month!",1,1
"Despite my friends telling me that I was paying a lot of money just for the Herschel sticker, I chose to go with my gut since the bag looked very good. While the bag does look very clean and spiffy, the quality and attention to detail in manufacturing is very subpar. The plastic clip broke on my first trip (writing this review as I'm waiting for the plane home and pissed off looking at this bag next to me) with very minimum usage. And for the very short amount of time that the shoulder strap did work, the cheap plastic clip squeaked with every step. Even though many reviews before me have stated this problem, i still bought it for its looks.... Karma for being a shallow pos.... The styling is nice, however, the quality is pure crap.  This was my third time using this bag and one of the handles broke off.  I was about to buy one of their backpacks, but have reconsidered. I actually ended up going to a Mori's luggage and picking up this bag because amazon failed to deliver on time but I LOVE this duffel. Its has been to Amsterdam, Tokyo, Mexico and more with me. It looks great and holds TONS of stuff including a pair of shoes in the dedicated pocket seperate from your clothes. I have the navy blue with white stripes and I get compliments on it everywhere I go. This was used! Came dirty and with a men’s sock inside?! Is this a joke? I fell for the brand hype. ""The Finest Quality"" is the motto. Doesn't live up to the hype. This bag looks great but its made from cheap materials. The fake leather is not nice. One of the plastic connectors between the bag and strap broke. There are far better options out there that actually are of decent quality. This bag looks great and I will say the shoe pouch is a nice and smart feature, but the construction is cheap. My wife always wanted to put her stuff in with mine when we went on short trips and a decent bag should be able to accommodate some strain, but the zipper broke and became completely useless shortly after a few “oversized” uses (not even that oversized). I realized this brand is cheap but expensive and I can’t bring myself to give them anymore money. I am sure they are paying a Chinese manufacturer a few bucks per bag and slapping their label on it. Purchased this for my brother as a Christmas gift, and he loved it! The shoe pocket that is featured on this bag is awesome. The bright red and white lining is another great feature of this bag, as it makes things easy to find within the bag. The overall size of the bag is what I think I liked the most about it. Not too big and bulky, yet still large enough to bring a weekend's worth of clothes in. The quality is easy to tell from the zippers to the general construction of the bag. Great job, Herschel Supply Co! You guys have outdone yourselves and helped me give a great Christmas present! I've use this bag twice now which I bought on a recommendation, I should've read the reviews first.  The bag self is great size, however the zipper looks like it's going to come apart and shoulder strap squeaks like mad.  I can't stand it so back it goes!  You would think the company would do something about the plastic connecting the straps given the bag it's so heavily branded.  I'm walking through the airport and the bag is squeaking with every step I take.  Drives me crazy can't stand it!",1,1

"It smells and tastes very bold and delicious! My husband really liked this over other coffees he's tried so I bought this. Very smooth.....fresh and delicious. I loved this when I could get it for my Keurig machine........can't get it now, but this is good enough to make it worthwhile to do a single cup drip to start the day. Very, very nice.......I love strong coffee and this stands up to the strong brewing without a trace of bitterness or acid. Thanks Amazon! When I opened the package I knew I was in trouble.  The coffee is slightly bitter but even worse has no delicious flavor as I would expect from Wolfgang Puck. The ""aroma"" from the opened package should have given me a clue.  I'd return it but it's more trouble than it's worth. I am normally a Starbucks French Roast drinker, but as the price is up to and over $1 per oz, I was looking for a substitute. It is slightly less rich in flavor as SBucks, if I could give it a 4.5 stars, that might be fitting. However, for the value for the 2 lb bag, it is far worth the small difference in taste. ASIN: B004OVGF14 This has to be the nastiest tasting coffee i had in a long time. There is no coffee smell to it when you grind the beans. I had to double up on the scoops to get a coffee taste out of it. Too bad, it cannot be returned. Great coffee! We are heavy coffee drinkers and love to try different types all the time. I was hopeful that this would be great quality and we were turned off by the strong, heavy flavor with almost a musty tone to it. Perhaps it was old, I didn't see any date on the bag. We will finish it and with enough creamer in it we can tolerate it but wont purchase again. Originally found Wolgang Puck's coffee in a  CA supermarket and tried to get it later in AZ  without success. The flavor has a deep satisfying rich taste like a European cafe.  It is not overbearing but robost and I was happy to locate it on Amazon.  It is delivered on a schedule and in between times I do try other coffees but I am always happy when the Vienna coffee arrives.",1,1

"After having bought adidas NEO Kids' Baseline Cmf Sneaker size 5 for my 10 mo son, I decided to buy the same size of these expecting it would be the same fit. However, this pair's velcro is shorter than adidas NEO. My son doesn't have high arch, but these shoes seem tight on the top of his feet. So it's worse when he's wearing thick socks. It's hard to put on. These shoes are life and my daughter Loooves them. They are Adorable and so comfortable and soft on the inside. I bought my 2 yr old girl size 1-4 Yrs wich came as a 6M fit True to  size and she has a little spase to grow in Prefect sneaker. I get so many compliments when my grandson wears them.  They can be dressed up or down. Nice shoes, runs somewhat large than expected. Great shoes, but I’ve only had them for a couple weeks and the Velcro is already coming off on one side. These shoes look great and go with anything. just what i expected its great. Beutiful... Great for my kid",1,1

"I’ve been drinking + trying hazelnut coffees for about ten years now, so have designated myself an expert.  During this time, I’ve tried about 10 different hazelnut brands on Amazon and another dozen from Target, etc.  I felt compelled to write this review because this coffee is the REAL DEAL!  Hands-down, the best flavor and smoothness out of any coffee I’ve tried.  I actually get excited when waking up because I know Joe is waiting for me.  I make the coffee in the Keurig using a refillable filter and it’s just perfect.  I also highly recommend this Almondmilk French Vanilla creamer (dairy-free).  You can get it at Whole Foods or other comparable stores. Trust me, the two together is like finding soulmates who have been looking for each other.  Happy drinking. This is good not great but I would buy it again. Kinda strange the bag wasn't vacuum sealed. I know I have never bought coffee that wasn't vacuum packed before. Maybe if it had been vac packed it would,be more flavorful. Very strong smell of pumpkin spices (cinnamon, cloves, some ginger). It has a very strong body, which overwhelms most of the pumpkin spice when it comes to flavor, but the scent alone carries this coffee very well. If you want a stronger, earthier coffee, with a super strong pumpkin spice aroma, then this if for you. Really good taste. If you are a pumpkin & spice maniac then use just this coffee. Otherwise, I'd recommend doing a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4 with regular coffee being the greater portion thereof. The ritual of blending of a flavored coffee with a high-grade regular coffee is a fun one, enjoy! I've always loved this coffee because it isn't acidic unlike other brands. Our current favorite ground coffee.  Strong but not bitter.  And the price is great.  The 2 pound bag is great for a large group of coffee drinkers. My all time favorite coffee!  I found it by accident over a year ago and now wouldn't buy anything else.  Yummmyyy. This is our favorite coffee!  I usually can buy it at Marshalls at $4.99/lb and have been known to clear their shelves when I can find it.  Great, robust, smooth flavor that I like way better then Starbucks.",1,1
"I did not receive the product despite receiving an email from Lazada saying that it has been delivered I received an email from Lazada indicating that my item has been delivered, but I never received it. I have never received the item u cheating me Edit: After using this several times since, I would like to rescind my previous review and now say that this works. New pimples are quickly diminished within 8 hours, and another applied patch eliminates it with barely a scar left. Will definitely continue to use this!  The first couple of times I used, I did notice my pimples diminishing but not completely eradicated. I was a little disappointed because I expected a lot from this after reading the rave reviews online, but then again the pimples that I used these on were not fully developed. The most recent time I used this, it proved its worth - my fully developed pimple was gone as quickly as it randomly came. There are patches of different sizes to cover the different pimple sizes that you sadly get. Cosrx is one of my trusted brand",0,0
"This device is so unreliable I seen the reviews and still decided to give it a try after all the 1 stars I seen but this device is hands down trash I’m switching over to VDO Road Log ELD Plus I love the TND 540 GPS tho I will keep that but far as ELD for Rand Mcnally save your money guys I’m telling you the Gods honest truth The cost  is too expensive., Otherwise the product is great. Would give it O stars.  Piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY.  Does not stay connected and you cannot change the drive time, even though it shows you only drove 4 hours when you actually drove 9.  I even bought a tablet to use solely for this device and it still doesn't work.  It will get you shut down.  AND, so far i cannot get customer service on the phone to return it.  I did not buy this from amazon.  I bought it from Rand McNally.  So, their customer support is as crappy as their product.  Fair Warning. I bought this at local Petro thinking Im all set for elog mandate. Started using it immediately. Plugged it in, set up was simple and I was on my way. After 4hrs of driving it disconnected from my android phone and then showed last 3hrs of driving as on duty, which I had to edit it later. I was ok with that. Couple days later I was driving and it disconnected again and app froze up. Ive tried to restart app on my phone and it just kept freezing up my phone and shutting off app. Husband has had in his truck 2 weeks doesn't work half of the time. He is looking to replace it already. Kepts me on ""ON Duty"" while I was driving DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE!!! I would give it 0 stars. I just waited over an hour on hold so I could cancel my monthly subscription fee. Freezes up, and no support.",1,1

"These are really great panties (really comfy), except one package I got had a flaw.  I have bought two packages, the second pack in late March (high-cut, size 7).  After one wash from the newest pack I noticed one pair had a hole in the seam (not a rip) where the thread had unraveled.  Not too big a problem, I thought - maybe just a one-off.  Then this morning I pulled out another pair and a large portion at the elastic had unraveled. Having always had 100% cotton panties, was a bit hesitant to try a different material.  Very glad I did. Love this microfiber material. These panties feel very soft against the skin and are cooler than cotton. The built in stretch with the spandex content should help them stay feeling comfortable even with normal weight fluctuations. It was a great choice on my part..I usually wear a size 7 or 8, but at 70 years old I don't like them snug, so picked the 9's and they are terrific..very soft and comfortable.. I would recommend them .. This is my third pack of these panties. I wore only cotton panties for decades, but when they started being made with cotton that was scratchy and rough, I decided to try these microfiber panties, and I'm so glad that I did. I bought my first pack over a year ago, so I have given them a good test run. I love the fact that they are super soft and comfortable. I also like the fact that they are very stretchy, so they are easy to pull up and down. I'd say that they are true to size, and if they do shrink at all, it's not significant, as with cotton panties. My only complaint is that you don't get to choose the colors you want. Every pack is different, and some of the colors are very dark, and others are very vibrant. Out of three packs, I only got one panty that was white. There's no cotton in these panties, so they don't have a true cotton crotch. But they have a sort of padded feel and texture in that area, so it hasn't been a problem, even with occasional bladder dribbles. I continue to order them from Amazon because it sure beats rummaging through the underwear department in local stores to find the right size in the right style (in this case, ""Hi-Cut""). I have turned my back on cotton panties for good, and I couldn't be happier! Well I thought they were great. No unraveling BUT; after the 4th washing the elastic started to come away from the fabric on the top. I liked these so much until this started that I threw away all my old ones so cannot even return the damned things now. What the hell do I do about this? I cannot sew them because of arthritis in hands! Would NOT/ NOT/ NOT/ EVER recommend these! . I got Size 8. I am 5'1"", 169lbs, waist 28""-30"", hips 45"". At first glance it looked like it could be too big but when I put it on, it was uber comfy. I tend to wear strictly cotton underwear and I went out on a limb with this one. It feels light and airy. Almost like I am not wearing any panties. Perfect! I usually never buy my underclothes online because I like to see what I am paying for, they do fit right which I am happy about, but I am not sure if it's a mistake with the company or not these that I received are not microfiber they are the regular gotten, also none of the colors were what was showing or even close I ordered thinking that I would receive six pair but there were only five, also I think that I paid too much for what I was expecting next time I will have my nurse go and buy my underclothes, on the positive side they are true to the size which I am happy about and they do fit nice and comfortably I am just a little bit disappointed that they're nothing like I was expecting. Normally fit a small, ordered a small. They fit but are actually kinda weird in the butt. Maybe it's because I don't have a whole lot going on back there, I don't know. But these are the only kind that have been like this. The back part goes pretty high up, to my dimples even.  Which is weird for me. Not completely uncomfortable, just not good to wear with certain clothes. Otherwise for comfortable or period days these work well. For the pack you get 6 which is a good price.",1,1
"I think I am going to love this cookware. I have used  it but three  times and  following the instructions, with my  own recipes, meats were cooked to perfection. The veggies do cook in a vapor seal, be careful on your cook times with this...the vacuum created would not let me remove the lid from 2.3 qt casserole I used on my electric cooktop.Reheating to temp allowed me to remove the lid easily. READING the instructions is a must with this  new  kind of cooking...clean up was a breeze...I used barkeeper's friend with a sponge. 360cookware website  also provides recipes and cooking instructions....in researching the different sets available I've  notice that they do not come with smaller pots, like 1 quart. For this cookware to work properly the  pans  should be filled 2/3's with food. As I am now only cooking for two, I will mostly be using smaller sized pots. I will probably supplement this set with some small sauté and sauce pots.This cookware will outlive me, new couples should consider this investment...I will also add that this  cookware is replacing my All-Clad (Every piece is warped and will not sit flat on stovetop) and 360 is heavier than the all-clad. Excellent cookware!  Wife & I love it! Best cookware in the world! Seem very nice. extremely sturdy and reliable! Top notch cookware you will enjoy. Worth the money",1,1
"All the pretty colors. I love these glasses. I can leave a pair where ever I may be going. I keep a pair at work, in my bag, over my bed side, and in my shoulder bag. No nose thingys that always seem to bend in the wrong way on my nose. No crooked fittings. The arms are sturdy and comfortable on my face. I refuse to buy a pair of glasses for a couple of hundred dollars. At 50 years old, I still am not mature enough to keep an expensive glasses safe, or even keep them at all. Great glasses! What I like about them: These are a great accessory for those of us who choose to not purchase bifocals . . . just yet. The fun pattern and colors are a great way to punch-up your look a little and be more stylish while reading documents. I also purchased ""idiot strings"" (eyeglass chain) so I can keep my readers with me at all times by simply hanging them from my neck when carrying them is not an option. They're ok, I kind of feel that I should have paid less (I have bought many similar plastic reading glasses for $2 each at wholesale odd-lot shops). I wanted something closer to bright jewel tones, and these colors are far more understated and muted than the photo shows.  That said, they are good for when you want a bit of color without drawing a lot of attention to the glasses. I love these! I ordered in 3.5, a strength that is very hard to find in brick and mortar shopping, in any style, without paying a fortune. These are beautiful. I also have a slightly 'crooked' head, so fixed arms often sit askew or break easily. The spring arms allow these to fit perfectly. I will be ordering these again. I have a bad habit of leaving and losing glasses in various places; at this price those losses won't hurt at all. I really needed a red pair, but the red isn't even close to red.  in fact there isn't a color for what it is.  (a burnt pinkish red orangy look).  Doesn't go with anything.  The blue is more a peacock blue.  Not at all what I expected.  The black & purple are ok. I don't need readers.  Really, there's nothing wrong with my eyes.  I've been reading for decades.  It's not me.  It's the publishers and printers who insist on using smaller and smaller fonts on books, menus, instruction sheets, etc.  I think the way they conspire to make me feel old is awful and should be looked into by some sort of government agency. I can't speak for any of you, but we have ""readers"" laying all over the place - everywhere you need to see things (the car, the kitchen drawers, the living room, bedroom, bathroom, patio, lanai, garage, etc.) When we saw this four-pack of cute and stylish glasses available at this reasonable cost, we picked them right up.",1,1

"Phone didn't appear to be refurbished. Some pretty deep scratches on the screen and the case which led me to question the integrity of the rest of the hardware. Returned it and ended up buying a full priced new phone. I purchased a refurbished Pixel from this seller, claimed to be fully functional. The device was unable to connect to WiFi (not functional right out of the box). Spent a few hours trying different methods to connect and contacted customer support, who had me try additional methods; nothing worked. Got the Pixel right on time, charger and cable included in the original box. Everything seemed to work perfectly but WiFi, it started to drop the connection since settings it up. Tried network settings restore, factory settings restore, no change at all. Return process and refund under way. Such a shame, everything else was great about it, battery life up to 3 days, performance above any iPhone, Galaxy S3 or any other high end phone. I was psyched about this phone, and the one they sent looks cosmetically fine. Unfortunately, it's completely broken and unusable. Freezes, resets again and again, and when it does turn on I get error message after error message. I'll be returning it. DO NOT BUY, IT WILL BREAK.  I bought this phone Sept 15 and it died Jan 1.  Two weeks past the 90 day warranty.  Prime mobility refuses to help me either with replacement or refund.  Advertising as ""certified refurbished"" suggests manufacturer approval, but this fraud company is selling junk phones that die within weeks.  DO NOT BUY.  I can't believe I wasted almost $500.  Will look into reporting to Amazon.  This should be illegal. I regret buying this ""certified refurbished"" phone. In the future I'll stick with new or ""manufacturer refurbished"". The power adapter that came with this phone didn't work. I called the number provided on the enclosed card to ask for a new adapter and got someone who didn't speak much english. Once I conveyed my need for a new power adapter I waited a couple of weeks and nothing arrived. I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they allowed me to get a new power adapter from their site at no charge. Nice. But now, 3 months later the phone microphone and speaker don't work during phone calls. So discouraging. Mic won't work so no phone calls and more.",-1,-1
"This was my second round with SafeTStep shoes. I love them, especially in the wintertime. I should have ordered two pairs of my last shoe, though, because my size was out of stock when I went to reorder. I tried ""wide"" for the first time, and they are just as comfortable. The shoe laces are a bit too long, though, and I need to triple tie them just to keep the ends off the floor. More importantly, one the metal shoelace eyelets broke apart and both halves fell out of the hole on the first full day of wearing them. They're just shoes and no one's going to notice two halves of an eyelet bouncing around in the center of my laces but me, but still, it points to quality issues. Decent shoes. We'll see how long they last. I had to order one half size larger than my actual shoe size (12 1/2), but I always have to do that, because nobody can be bothered to stock my actual shoe size. And at that, I have trouble with my right big toe pushing against the side of the shoe. But again, that happens with pretty much every pair of shoes I wear. Finding comfortable shoes are always difficult for those of us with big feet, especially when you're buying a pair for a particular purpose (in this case, work shoes). I just wish shoe stores, manufacturers, etc would recognize and accommodate those of us who weren't gifted with small feet. I've had these shoes for 10 months now, so I've had plenty of time to try them out. The shoes feel great and hold up well over time. They only show minor wear after all this time. The only problem I've had with these shoes is with the laces that come with it. I've never had a pair of shoes that had laces which untie while walking as often as these do. I find myself having to retie the shoes at least once a day because they came untied while I was walking around. This does not occur with other shoes similar to these in the past and does not occur with other shoes I currently own. There just seem to be something about these laces which allow them to come loose. Other than this, the shoes have been very good. These are my go to shoes for work. I like that they're slip-resistant and made out of synthetic materials, so they're vegan. They're easy to polish if need be, or you can just rinse them off and let them dry. Great for the office as well as comfy and street ready for the urban commute. I can usually find them at Payless as well. I purchased these for my 15 year old son to wear to his first job.  It was a requirement that his shoes be slip resistant. I have been disappointed in the comfort of these shoes.  Very little cushion and no arch support.  They hurt my feet after only a couple hours, even if I am not on my feet.  They are, however, very skid resistant in a commercial kitchen setting. Got size 12 and fits as expected. Bought these for my waiter/bartender son.  He said they were just what he needed for those slippery floors. Also said they were very comfortable.",1,1

"I bought this for my Husband who had one many, many years ago and I thought this would be a good gag gift. It is a Fruit of the Loom t shirt and is good quality. It is sized to fit as expected. The lapel on the screen print is shiny so I'm not sure how that will look after a few washing's but only time will tell. Hopefully he will get a few laughs out of this. It would make a good costume as well. As a blogger I received this product at a steep discount in exchange for a review. This was perfect...i have an office mascot who dresses up each month...so here he is ready for New Years The shirt is well made and sized as we expected. It will be a fun shirt to wear to a party we're going to. My husband will wear it because it's not too over the top but fun and interesting enough to get noticed. Upon arrival I discovered the transfer was peeling off in the center.  I contacted seller and had zero problems with a return for a refund. Good seller and I'm sure the shirt was a random issue. Served it's purpose when new, but after one wash, it became a hand-me-down.  Fabric is thin. Ordered 4 for son to use with friends in a skit, one image was slightly off center but ok, not a big deal...

"These are FANTASTIC! I love the look, exactly as pictured. I got them in the Rouge Raisin and I love the color. So sizing was a bit of a question. I have never owned a pair of UA sneakers before, so I wasn't sure what to compare them to size wise. I wear a 9 1/2 in Nike and Puma, but 8 1/2 in shoes like Vans and Converse. Given there was a $30 price difference between the 9s and 9 1/2, I decided to try out the 9s. Other than being a little narrower they are definitely long enough. I think a half size bigger might have been to big in the long run. Given the material, I'm sure these will stretch JUST ENOUGH to fit me perfectly. I like these shoes they definitely run small I got a half size up and they run narrow however they are a good shoe. Not quite as comfortable as my other UA shoe but these are good. I basically got them more for looks than for performance. These are perfect for weight lifting as the bottom part is flat. Good shoe though for me. I would get another pair just loosen up the shoe ties and it fits comfortably. Under armour brand runs small... I had to return them to purchase the next half size up. Once I get the right size, they are awesome I absolutely love these shoes, being a dance teacher I’m always on my feet and moving these shoes are perfect!!! I wear thin socks and my regular Nike ankle socks and have no problem. I did get a .5 size bigger based on other suggestions and there are perfect!!! Highly recommend!! Getting the white pair next time! I wear a size 10 so I bought a 10.5 and they fit perfect absolutley love them. Light weight and comfortable. I get lots of compliment. I would buy again. Love these shoes because they are perfect right out of the box!❤️👍 So many compliments on these. SO PRETTY TOO. amazing shoe, lightweight, and you have to love that color!",1,1
"Love this shampoo and conditioner. It smells so good and makes your hair feel sleek and smooth without being heavy or oily. Not a fan, doesn't smell very good kind of a mix of a hair salon and nail salon smell. Feels like it dries my hair out. I like the nexxus oil infinite shampoo and conditioner much better! My hair looks so healthy with this product.  It smells great and very light weight.  Definitely controls frizz and my hair is so shiny! Wasn't very optimistic about product when I bought it, but after buying it but it did take down my frizzy ness !!! Very pleased would buy again!*** We both have crazy thick curly long hair. Tames it perfectly. Smells nice.  Made my daughters hair look very nice.  Great price on here product works will, i just do not like the smell. changing product review to 5 stars. it may not be for me but i like the smell of it on my husband and he likes the product well! Cleans my hair just fine, but it's WAAAAAAY too perfumy, in a sort of heavy smell, musty kind of way",1,1
"This was purchased for a wedding and the color was exactly what we wanted. The color and fabric are great for the price. Even more, it arrived super quick from the seller. Would highly recommend. The groom absolutely loved it - it was perfect to wear with his tux. Very, very happy with this purchase. Looked great on my son for prom, and I saved money and hassle. The quality was more than acceptable for the price. The tux itself was better quality than I was expecting,  if you're going to take the jacket off.) The jacket and pants were true to size, and the accessories were good quality. I'd highly recommend going this route over renting! For the price, this tux is everything you could want in a very nice product for your son or husband. The fit is excellent and so is the quality. Very happy with the purchase. And it cost less than the cost of a rental. Very happy with my purchase.  Looks and fits great, good communication with seller, timely delivery My son looks so handsome in this suit!",1,1
"Re ordered from last years order (it asks you if you want to order again) believing I was getting the exact same thing.  These bags are not the same quality.  I could tell right away by their transparency.  I had a few of last year's order left and they are definitely thicker than these.  Never had a problem with the handles tearing.  Used 15 of them today and the handles broke  along their top edge on 5 of them.  The handles are narrower and the seaming on the top poor.  See pics. Last year's bags are on the left. The photo of entire bag:  about 5 stacked of old ones, entire stack of new ones and they are still more transparent. I have ordered these bags several times over the years to use for cat litter waste and the bags sent this time are not the same. They are substantially thinner, the print on the front is different, and the box is even different. I am including pictures and the thinness of the bag is even more dramatic in person. So useful! It is used mainly as a kitchen trash bag as apartment living allows me to dispose trash daily down the trash chute. The material is sufficiently thick enough that it does not tear or leak easily. Even when filled with liquid, it did not break when I accidentally droped it once from a height of 5 feet. Just wished the bags were just plain - it has words all over it. These were exactly what I needed - about the same size and a bit stronger than the plastic bags (now outlawed here in Ca) that we used to have available in grocery store checkout lines.  We needed this size at an affordable price for the cat little we scoop up everyday.  The other ""cute"" ones made for picking up poop while walking a dog or even those advertised for cats don't work because they are so small and the opening is so small.  These open VERY wide so we don't spill the little when placing it from the litter box into the bag.  We also ordered a small (~ 6 x 4 ) small metal trash can with a step lid (mimics the stainless steel ones) so we can actually place the bag open inside that can and use it many times before throwing it outside - with no odor in the room.  This is a great buy. ✩✩✩✩✩Everyday Primer No BS Review✩✩✩✩✩ I bought these bags for my litter box cleanups.  Same brand I have always bought but this time they are much thinner and some have had holes in them (and this requires some double bagging). bought these to use for litter box clean up following the single use bag ban here in California.  While they work great, I find them too large for this purpose and feel a bit wasteful using them for just a couple scoops of used litter.  After I use these up, I will look for a slightly smaller bag.  I read some reviews that said these bags were too thin, but I find them to be slightly thicker than what I used to get at the grocery store. We are thrilled to death  Literally !!! to  purchase your bags. California barely passed that stupid law about plastic bags. I refuse to buy plastic grocery bags at stores. Makes no sense, we were told that they were getting rid of plastic completely. Which CA. Has not. It's cheaper getting bags this way & your bags are just as reusable. They work great & I'm passing the word on  guaranteed . 👍🏼👍🏼",1,1

"For the price, this was a great vest/bow tie combo. I would suggest ordering one size smaller than usual Material is a little thin so if feels cheaper than expected, but it fits nicely. nice for $ What should I say I have great taste and this garment accentuates it when properly worn and fitted in the correct venue. This was a good buy for the price.  Bought this for Homecoming and it looked very nice.  It was a lot cheaper than purchasing from a department store.",1,1
"It looks great. Feels durable. Well constructed. This is by far my favorite neck tie, and I own a lot of neck ties. The material is thick and high quality. The skinniness is enough to look modern, but not so much that it looks awkward. It's the perfect width, in my opinion. The color is dark enough that it doesn't stand out more than it should, but it's got a good silky shimmer and the stripes add a nice touch for design. The tie is easy to tie and it stays in place well. It is a good length. I am 6'2"" and this tie fits just fine. I do like it, but it wasn't what I was hoping it would be. This tie isn't just ""skinny,"" it's ""micro."" It's actually a little too thin for my tastes. The tie does not actually have black stripes, but the way the fabric is textured makes it look like it has black stripes. I really wanted a solid textured purple tie that would also work with brown pants, but the appearance of black in the stripes makes it a so it really only works with black pants. I'm keeping it and will wear it, but it won't get worn often. I really  love this tie. The color  is just as amazing  . I got compliments on  this tie will be odering more. Got it sooner then expected witch is always a plus It most definitely has BLACK STRIPES.  Please see picture of close up.  I thought it was tone on tone texture, but no it really has black stripes.  Not what I expected and I probably would not have ordered it, but I think it will work.  Material feels good, heavy and the size is just right for a skinny tie. Fabulous tie, well made. It doesn't appear or feel cheap or flimsy. Love the skinny tie look to change up a look. So, I'm returning this because the fiance thought it was too skinny, but the plum color was beautiful and it looked well constructed. To be very clear, the tie is 2 inches at the base before the tie comes to a point. Upward it is closer to 1.5 inches (I measured). So, just be aware it is a true skinny tie and 2 inches is not the overall size. Also, he is 6'3"" and the length was good! Really can't complain at all.  The tie obviously is not the highest quality and, given that I am 6'4, there are some issues with the length. That, however, is not a knock against the tie itself, as that is just a given for people my height. Overall, fairly happy with what I got for the money.",1,1
Product received in good condition. Arrived in good condition,1,1
"Quick delivery, nice packaging, nice product! Cute and unique design, far more than expected... Looks better than the photo online!! Love it so much!!! Strongly recommend my friends to order one... Got it for my mother as a Christmas gift, she loves it. She has reactions to fake jewelry and she is able to wear this all the time with no issue! I love my sterling silver antler ring.. it is adjustable and small.",1,1
"I have fine long hair and this stuff is great. Smells great also. I have very long, fine hair, colored and damaged. I tryed this conditioner and it was amazing, my hair is so soft, silky, and has body...the smell is wonderful... Not overwhelming, a nice clean fresh smell. Ordering shampoo and more conditioner I love it! ApotheCARE Essentials the Colorist Shampoo, Lavender, Moroccan Mint, Cactus Milk had initially left me with many positive impressions, and I was ready to buy the counterpart conditioner. The name alone, ApotheCARE, gives you the feeling of being cared for and understood. The packaging is just as pleasing and the pump bottle is tidy and convenient to dispense. In addition, the scent smells clean and natural and enhanced with a sweet vanilla fragrance. Though the shampoo is on the thick side, it washes the scalp well and rinses flawlessly. I found the results to be a notch up as compared to my other shampoos since it leaves my hair silky and not at all dry. I'm a guy. I like my hair. I may be skinny fat, average in intelligence, and I don't wear the lastest fashion. But I do want to care for the one thing I have going for me: my hair. Easter European ultra thin hair. It likes to frizz when cut short and do it's own thing when long. But when it is 3/4"" long and with the right shampoo and conditioner, it looks great. My wife absolutely loves this conditioner!  The first thing was the smell.  She's not sure if it's the vanilla or almond scent that she's smelling.  But, it's a light refreshing scent that stays on her hair all day long.  I also love the scents I smell when I'm beside her and the wind catches her hair.",1,1
"For the price of these, they are fantastic. They look great and I mixed with grayones as well. After 6 months the colors are still great. Only issue is that they still are leaving fuzz after this many months (some say that's a good thing?). The black is much more ""fuzzy"" than the gray ones. Either way I really recommend this product in all colors. Terrible quality, left little pieces of themselves everywhere on use. I thought this might just be because they were new, but it persisted after a few washes. I tried washing them a few times, and found large chunks in my washing machine. These towels are the best! They are fluffy and absorbent. They are even soft enough to use on my soft babies' skin. They don't fray or fade in the washer, and I wash mine twice a week. I have a set in every bathroom, a different color for each. I have the chocolate brown ones in my bathroom, and they are still the same vibrant, shiny brown they were when I bought them two and a half years ago! When I redecorate, or accidentally splash bleach on one (that only happened once!), this brand is the only one I'll buy. I highly recommend these towels, as they are the best quality for the price, and better than most that are pricier! Just received them, but the towels started unraveling before the washer. I took the pack to the washer, was happy with the softness so I began to take them out. Just pinching them to pull them out of the pack, some of the strands would unravel. Very easy to pull apart. Don't think they'll last long at all. I bought these to replace some towels that we had for years that were wearing out. I needed the same color, and it was getting hard to find. I ordered these, because the color was right, and kept my fingers crossed that we would like them. A few months ago, I purchased 2 of the oversized bath sheets in teal and we like them so much I thought I'd get some hand towels in the same color.  The bath sheets have been machine washed and dried dozens of times by now and still look as if they're brand new.  There has been no fading, bleeding or shedding, nor problems of any kind. I had to watch these towels separately several times and there is always so much lint! By mistake, I also washed a pillow case with them and now, I cannot get all of the lint off the pillowcase no matter what I try. The towels are nice and I like them, but the lint is too much. Great bang for the buck. I washed them after receiving them and they did shed quite a bit of lint and color but overall are very absorbent.",1,1
"I've owned pan sets that cost hundreds of dollars.  I've tried several of the  newer ""non-stick"" pans, all of which are in the garbage right now.  Lets face it, most of us use only a couple of the pans that come with pan sets.  I decided to buy only the pans that I know that I need and will use.  I bought a set of ceramic coated fry pans, but I needed sauce pans.  Anticipating the delivery of my new range, I decided to go back to stainless steel. Love these pots & pans! They look so elegant and are a great product for the price! Great packaging too! Arrived on time. Cookware worked pretty well for first month. Later I started seeing rust on the screws on the lid. I got it replaced with new one however it has the same problem. Now, I have the pots with rusted lids. This rusting started happening after 1 month or so. It's stainless & required a ""lower heat"" change for the non chef! I bought this set of stainless steel cookware for Christmas and my husband and I love it! It was delivered just on time for xmas! Good quality! Highly recommend it! Great looking set, easy to use, easy to clean, handles don't get hot while you are cooking, see thru lids with good size handles. I'm glad I purchased them. Great price too!! They seem to be good for six months. The vessels started rusting and the non stick coat was coming off. I needed cookware that had pots over frying pans. I belong to a wholesale warehouse and priced a set there then checked Amazon and found the 12 piece Concord Cookware that filled the bill at a great price, half that I would pay at my wholesale warehouse. I used the cookware twice the second time I noticed the speed that it cooks. I made a veggie stew that took two larger pots to cook down to fit into the largest pot. Two veggies that takes the longest to cook potatoes and carrots along with all the other veggies were put on a very low simmer gas flame. I expected it would take three to four hours to cook, but to my surprise it took I would say less than two hours much sooner than I expect with a very low flame. The design of the pot's bottom intensifies the heat where it cooks quickly with low heat. Love the set and a good purchase.",1,1
"These are pretty great considering that they have a very simple list of ingredients, actually have CHEESE in them, and aren't colored florescent orange. While health(ier) than the Cheez Doodles that we all know and love (and have stained things with orange fingers after eating), these still have 7 grams of fat per sorta-generous bag, so it's not a guilt-free snack. But if you can spare the calories/fat and are jones-ing for a cheesy, crunchy snack, these are pretty great. I'm just happy that my daughter (who is seven) considers THESE the ""ideal"" cheese puff and considers the bright orange ones in the big, clear bag way too greasy and tangy. I wanted to find something to snack on a bit more healthy. Well, the problem is when you get a snack that is better for you. An issue you run into is that you still end up eating too much. These were that good. My kids loved them a lot as well. I wish I would have bought more than one bag. Approximately one third of the bags taste noticeably stale, despite being within the expiration date of December 2015. I used to buy these at my local gas station until they stopped carrying the brand, and the puffs were always light and crisy. Many of these are closer to chewy and they don't taste fresh. I assume this is probably from exposure to heat in storage or some other similar condition. As other reviewers have mentioned these are a mixed bag of stale and not stale puffs (-1 star). The price is right and the stale ones still taste okay enough to enjoy so would recommend buying. I like this version of this brand of snacks the best- they're puffed ""Cheetos"" without the neon orange powder... taste is very similar. Love these things! I wouldn't call them healthy, but I like seeing the short ingredient list and I can feel good about my son getting them as an occasional snack.  I will say, while it's not a single serving bag, it's not a large bag either and I suggest portioning the puffs out, because it's super easy to eat almost a whole bag in one sitting if you're not careful. I've bought everything Pirate Brands has made (except for Potato Flyers) and this one is probably the best overall. My wife and I can't stop eating these. They're simply awesome. Very cheesy, good texture, very easy to chew, no greasy/oily aftertaste or residue on your hands, just precious cheese dust! We like mixing these up with other cheese snacks (pirate booty, gold fish crackers, etc) and pretzels for a nice custom snack mix. These are sure to please anyone that likes cheese curls, just don't tell whoever you give them to that they are more healthy than normal cheese puffs and they'll never know the difference! I'm addicted to this stuff. As a volume eater, nothing is more satisfying than seeing a big mountain of a snack (this one, preferably) and knowing it's still shy of 200 calories.",1,1
"I was a bit worried when I ordered these shirts that they might be not up to par, as some have reported, but I was actually very pleased with my purchase, and promptly ordered a set of blue, and charcoal shirts as well. These are the first ones I've purchased in quite a while. Logo is on the pocket instead of the sleeve on the old ones. They fit fine but I can tell they are in no way the same quality and the material is stretchy. I'm sure they will shrink and probably be too small after a couple of washings. Just like a lot of other products, the quality is really going down..... Disappointed but not surprised. To be honest I haven't yet opened these recently ordered and received packages of shirts.  I have maybe a dozen or so of them which I've been wearing daily for 4-5 years and ordered these only to replace those if I ever wear them out.  They are excellent quality and have been washed so many time that It scares me now to think that they would still be presentable after all this time.  Besides being serviceable for so long I like the fact that they are longer than most other T shirts and so they still fully cover my large 'belly'.  They are generously cut and haven't shrunk much ---maybe just a tad---over all this time  (or maybe the truth is that I'm growing into them more than they are shrinking?  Anyway,  I give them very hi marks---in this day and age, where quality of anything you buy isn't what it used to be, I am proud to say that Dickey's still puts out 'old time quality products"" and I can't say anything but good about them. Gotta love Dickie work clothes...though I'm transitioning over to lighter materials with moister wicking properties...here in Florida it's hot most of the year and I sweat a lot...this can lead to rashes and body odor...less cotton and more nylon is key...So I've been getting 5.11 pants to combat these issues...plus 5.11 is function friendly... These are good heavy,comfortable shirts but the side seams are off. This makes them hard to fold with out getting creases in them. This may not be a big deal but the $5.00 shirts I buy at Walmart have straight even seams. My husband loves dickie shirts with the front pockets, but these definitely  run smaller than normal.  It's alittle hard to navigate thru the ordering, because I would like to get XL tall. Both shirts are of very good quality and the size is just right!  I most likely be ordering more for my husband.  He wants T-Shirts with pockets only so he can put his phone, etc there, rather in pant pockets.  He wears T-shirts more than front button shirts.  I highly recommend these to my friends. Five stars, subject to the usual caveat:  Is it really possible to evaluate a t-shirt I received about a week ago?  Long-term durability is the real test. This appears to be more like a medium weight shirt than the heavier Carhartt.  But for the price, the Dickies shirt seems to be a better value.  Fit is fine -- a true Large size for me, unlike the Carhartt that runs large (my L Crahartts seem more like an XLs).  Good size and well-reinforced pocket with discreet logo on the upper right corner.  (Pocket is always the big issue for me -- absolutely essential.)",1,1

"This magnifier is really not useable. Both the 10x and the tiny 45x lens area are too small to be of practical use. And Prime will not authorize a return. Bad deal The lens is good for the price. It's not the best quality, but it's fine for reading maps and other small print. The ""ergonomic handle"" didn't work for me at all.  I have small hands, and I found it very uncomfortable to hold. My husband liked the grip, so I gave it to him.  I contacted the company twice to ask if they had other magnifiers with a smaller handle. The first time, they sent a form letter that didn't respond to my question. The second time, there was no response at all. At the same time, they have sent numerous form letters saying how they hoped I was happy with the purchase and would leave a positive review. Much less power than stated. Way overpriced. Only two lens, 3x 15x. Compared this to other lens of known magnification. Folks, I don’t know if my eyes are failing as I get older or if the fine print is getting smaller on maps, advertising, instructions and product information, but I finally decided that I had to do something about it. Good clear glass lenses. Bright LEDs (requiring 3 AAA batteries, not included). The LED switch is push-on/push-off so there is no need to hold the switch down continuously. The large lens is good for reading tiny print. I don't use the small lens. It does have a higher magnification but needs to be held on or close to the object, magnifying about a 1/4 inch circle. I've been looking for a decent quality magnifying glass in order to study old detailed maps, and most of what I see is flimsy, poorly crafted optics, or super high-end and very expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this magnifying glass for the price point.  The lens is thick, sturdy and only has the slightest distortion at the extreme edges of the lens.  I was also surprised at how much difference the small LED lights make when studying detailed items, however, as the lights are quite bright, high gloss surfaces may throw some glare back at you.  Lastly, the unit just feels sturdy in your hand, a lot of that weight provided by the 3 AAA batteries in the handle.  Shipped on time and undamaged. This product gets five stars (works perfectly for my humble small-print-reading needs), but one was deducted, because of the slightly annoying set of followup emails that I involuntarily received from the seller pressing me to review and so on. One 'thank you and let us know if anything goes wrong' email is fine. Three with a hint of selfish press (for positive feedback towards the seller) apparently disguised as customer care is not. No big deal, but I am a very busy man (who probably should not be spending precious time writing this review), so even minor efficiency is appreciated. High quality magnifying glass. Was boxed and shipped great! Very satisfied.",1,1
"This was purchased as a gift for my wife... under the assumption it would be used for wires and cables and other electronic stuff. I travel on business quite a bit and need to take various electronics with me (I also repair hardware servers) and over the years my laptop bag has become a jumble of various bits and pieces that I need. I finally decided after this last trip to Africa I had to get better organized. So I purchased this roll-up case as one of the three possible solutions (which means I also bought two other cases of different styles). I like this case as it hold a bunch of stuff securely and rolls up into a neat package. I also put my Tile bluetooth tracker in it so it also serves a purpose for finding my bag if I get disconnected from it. All in all a neat bag that has good quality construction and I can recommend this if you're looking to neaten up your electronics. Very good value. We travel with a lot of devices and the cords are usually a mess in the backpack. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. It has a pocket and belt for just about everything. My only regret is that I should have purchased this earlier. Keeps cords and batteries well organized. Highly recommend this product I finally had the opportunity to test drive this bag on a short driving trip last weekend. A major drawback to it, in my opinion, is it is a tad too small to deal with the Apple laptop cord (the white square and the power cord combo.) I can get it zipped up but it is a real struggle trying to get the power cord in a pocket. With the power cord and square in there, plus a portable Bluetooth mouse it does not lay flat as shown in the Amazon photo. See my photos. This is for small electronics' cords - phones and tablets. Thumbdrive pockets would probably hold but I would use the zippered pockets for thumbdrives. If you're like most poeple, you have a lot of devices and wires to charge them. If you're like me, you're always losing them or have them break in your bag. UPDATE AGAIN: After the company read my review they contacted me, asked me for some details, and then provided a new roll-up. I certainly would give this company 5 Stars, and if this one doesn't separate as the earlier one did, I will come back here and upgrade my review. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I can add/subtract stuff and it gets thicker or thinner.  I love that it isn't some zippered thing that may or may not result in the zipper breaking if it's too full of stuff.",1,1
"I was wanting something reusable to remove my makeup at the end of the day rather than going through hundreds of wipes in a month. I figured I'd give this a whirl as I've heard great things about like-products. This ""Wonder Cloth"" is a joke. It doesn't remove anything, it just smears it and you have to use an alternate method to actually get it off your skin. I've washed it thinking perhaps a good clean would get the fibers loosened up and ready to go, nope. Still just smears it all over my face and...I have to use a wipe. If you're looking for 100% chemical-free makeup removal, I'd look elsewhere.. on actual makeup removal I'd give it 2 stars, on being stain-free I'd give it four. For the past few years i've bought makeup wipes and they either make my eyes burn or don't take off my makeup. I hate it when they dry out in the bag or box. I liked this because its more economical AND it takes off my makeup. I hate that even after the wipes, my face feels greasy. BUT ANYWAYS, this is a good alternative to the makeup eraser. I think it just costs more because they probably sponsor people to do demos on social media and stuff. For the ladies that are complaining that it doesn't take off their eye makeup.. you shouldn't be rubbing hard or trying to remove with a cloth or wipes alone. We like to have eye makeup that stays so obviously it is going to be tougher to remove. I usually use a cotton round with eye makeup remover liquid but i've switched to Pond's eye makeup remover cream and it works wonders. I just rub some on my eyes with my fingers gently, then I wipe it off with the wonder cloth and everything comes off. My eyes don't burn and my blackest black eyeliner comes off. It also rinses clean which surprised me. My face feels clean and my pores feel cleaner also (compared to using disposable cloths). I hope this helps!! plus this cloth doesn't have any color like other cloths.. *cough cough* I've been using this little wonder cloth for 6-7 years to initially wash of my oil based makeup remover before washing my face. I own 7 of these. One for each day of the week, to avoid contamination/breakout issues. This cloth not only removes all my make up with minimal effort, but the longish fibers on the cloth really get into to your pores and clean them out really well. By the time I am ready for my second cleanse, I can be confident all the color product has been removed thanks to my AHA cleanser and this wonder cloth. The cloth is gentle enough to use daily and provides minimal/mild exfoliation without having to scrub and tug at your skin. I absolutely love my Wonder Cloth! I use this soft little wash cloth on a near-nightly basis for removing makeup. I still tend to use coconut oil to remove my stubborn waterproof mascara, but the Wonder Cloth works perfectly for everything else (it will work for waterproof mascara, it just takes longer and you have to rub a bit, so I prefer coconut oil which also leaves your lashes soft, conditioned, and helps them grow faster). I love the way this cloth takes off makeup although I do use a cleanser, then use the wet cloth. I bought several of these. My last one was much smaller than the others I purchased, even though they are the same brand.  I gave 2 for Christmas gifts and they loved them as well. These are so much better than just a standard wash cloth.  They wipe off all my makeup after an oil remover is used and rinse perfectly clean.  I then use with a gentle cleanser and it exfoliates my skin.  I have two and rotate every few days between them. It works, I didn't find that the stains washed all out and I don't even use a lot of makeup.  I don't use any type of waterproof makeup of any sort and it left some minor stains in the cloth that have not washed out, but it does not affect the product's overall effectiveness.  I just hide it on a hook behind the bathroom door and no one is the wiser.",1,1

"It works really well and easy to pair, the sound quality is also great. Wow! I use this lavalier microphone for my class lectures and my conferences. It’s lighter than a regular microphone and most important it is hand free. All I have to do is to plug the receiver part in the back of my PA system and the mic automatically detected it. The volume can be controlled on both the lavalier mic and on the PA system. People could clearly hear my voice with no resonance from it. I can say that this unit is sold at a reasonable price for the performance it gives. The headset/transmitter are very light and comfortable to wear. Having volume up/down/mute buttons right on the transmitter are very helpful. The receiver is very small and doesn't take up much space. Together, they work great and are easy to use. Of the 63 reviews I saw before ordering, ALL were 5 stars except one and it was a 4 star. That is awesome and definitely helped me make the choice to order this product.  So, why do I give 3 stars?  I must use a 1/4"" male connector to use the product. The product does come with a short 3.55mm male-to-male cable and a 3.55mm female to 1/4"" male adaptor to help me however, the adaptor and cable are VERY CHEAP and DO NOT couple to make a secure connection.  Using the cable and adapter that came with the product only resulted in NOTHING but crackling sounds like you get when a speaker is not securely connected with it's cable.  I had to go and purchase the same two accessories from Guitar Warehouse in order to get the product to operate properly.  I did try the personally purchased items with the original equipment shipped and the connections between the original cable/adapter and my personal puchases would not result in secure connections.  WHAT A LET DOWN!  I wound up spending an additional $20 just to get secure connections.  If the cable/adapter that came with the product had been better quality and made a secure connection, then I would have given 5 stars.  ;-(  Good thing the headset product was only $37.88.  Very glad that the transmitter/receiver don't require batteries.  They are chargeable with the same charger that charges Android equipment.  One additional thing.  It would be very helpful if the product specifications listed on Amazon were clear that the receiver's input connector is 3.55mm. I'm in charge of a historical reenactment group that gives outdoor presentations to large groups so we need voice amplification. I do the narration while the rest of the group does the demonstration. Since we rarely have electric power available, wireless battery operated equipment is necessary. I need to be hands free during our shows so a lavalier or headset with a body pack is mandatory. I was looking to buy a wireless microphone for party use and found this one. This is a solidly built product.  The quality is good for my party use. People can hear the sound loud and clear. The price is relatively cheap. Highly recommend it! The documentation is not translated well and could be much clearer.  It took a while to understand the instructions for pairing and it didn't seem to quite follow the documentation when verifying it is paired but simply testing it showed it did pair correctly.  After that minor concern and delay I was amazed with the quality of the sound and the range.  I will use this in a busy garage to hold training classes.  It fits comfortably on my head and the microphone bends into place.  You do have to put the mic close to your mouth.  The other thing I am quite impressed with is in order to get feedback you have to be right in front and close to the speaker.  That makes this a great unit.  I am amazed with the unit for the price paid. this microphone have so clarity in sound input if a person want to enhance the sound input in computer for business or personal purpose then this is the best option with reasonable prize and come with all necessary appliances.",1,1

"These are really nice! super easy to clean and the color really pops. I don't understand why anyone would put this in the dishwasher it takes less than a minute to clean them. even things like scrambled eggs or oatmeal or chowder seem to come right out when washed with hot water. I've had no problems with the colors shipping or fading or any kind of damage. I use them on a gas stove and I ensure that the flames do not lick up over the side of the pot just like it says in the directions and I hand wash in hot water and there's never been an issue with them at all they are phenomenal. I bought these to replace a prior set of T-fal cookware. I've had the prior set of T-fal for about 7 years, and the black nonstick stuff is flaking/scraping off the bottoms of the pans. They got a lot of heavy use with metal utensils and tons of dishwasher/high heat drying. 7 years of unforgiving use was not a bad deal. I loved the color choices for these. This set of pots/pans is noticeably lighter in weight than my other T-fal set. I'm not complaining, though. No reason for a pot or frying pan to weigh 5 lbs. when you're trying to finangle multiple pots and pans on the stove, or carry them to the sink. I've used these pots/pans for about a week on a gas stove top, no sticking, no problems so far. For the price, if they last even 3 years, I'm fine with that. The color is a brilliant enamel robin's egg blue. Very pretty. Products are as advertised. Definitely love the color which is of course why I ordered these online instead of picking them up at the store in person. Not my first set of T-fal so I know what I'm getting for the money spent. Yes if you want something that will last 25 years and that can take a beating you should probably drop a little more cash. My old set started to flake away at the non-stick surface so these were a reasonable replacement. This is my very first set of new pots and pans so I was sure to read the directions. So far I've used them all several times and followed the instructions and treated them before hand as advised and haven't used extremely high heat. And I know some people had trouble with the paint rubbing off which I've yet to experience with this set but have in the past with others, which leads me to believe maybe overheating the pots can cause the paint to come off? Horrible product quality.. The glass lid shattered while cooking on low flame. I had heard good reviews for TFal and that's the reason I went ahead and bought it. Only to realise after using it for 20 days, that the product quality is way substandard. Tfal, please take a note of this and I request Amazon to look into this and reconsider its decision to affiliate itself with Tfal. 4 of my pans have the black anti-stick coating bubbling. They have not popped and no pealing, but why wait for the coating to break apart into my food. Have been a T-fal user for years.  These hot pink pots and pans are pretty but they are very lightweight and not sturdy like all my other T-fal purchases. Love the small frying pan for a single egg. PROS: I love Tfal. I've used it for years. I needed  a new set and apparently didn't research well enough. These pans are really small. Yes, I realize I could have/should have measured my old ones, made sure of the sizes. They are listed. It just never crossed my mind that they'd be so small. Three of the pans are not big enough for me to use. At all. The ""stock pot"" says it's 5 quart, but I tried to fit 5 quarts of water in it. No way. And the ""large"" skillet.... maybe the size of my last set's medium skillet. Moral to this story: Read the sizes. Make sure you know what you are getting.Also of note is the color. It is not the same blue shown in the photos. More of a teal.",1,1

"I am an artist by trade. I was searching and searching for a marker set with an aesthetically pleasing variety but could also meet my strict guidelines for functionality and purpose. I’m extremely thrilled that this market set does just that. I love these markers! Some people think one tip is enough, but trust me, 2 tips is much better! The dual tip is great for different levels of detail. The color selection is great, lots of bright colors as well as more earth tones and muted shades. Undercut Innovations really knows whet they are doing with these markers! I'm not a professional but I like to draw and color more than the average adult. I've gone through countless marker sets so I think I'm a pretty good judge of quality. I give these markers 5 stars for a few reasons: color selection is better than average and caps match the pen colors, easy to blend, brush tip is broad but firm enough that it hasn't frayed or lost shape, no issues with drying out and seems like they will last a while. Satisfied customer! Great markers with great color variety! The case is great for quick access. With my last marker set, I'd have to switch to a different marker if I wanted a different thickness. The dual tip makes switching easy and quick! I finished a mandala yesterday with these markers and there was no bleeding or smearing. I was also able to blend the colors together to create custom colors. I would highly recommend these markers and will be purchasing again for gifts!! My neices use these for coloring so they get a lot of use. The package is great for keeping them organized and we love the dual tips! No issues with drying out or breaking like other markers we have tried. 5 stars! Very happy with these markers!  I've had issues in the past with markers that bleed, but that is not the case with these.  Extremely pleased with the detailed precision these markers provide.  Will definitely order again when I run out. Best marker set for this price! The colors blended together with such ease my mother equated my last piece to that of Johannes Vermeer's later works. They also bleed little compared to other markers I've used. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to my Copics. The color variety is good and so far they have worked well. They blend easily and no issues with drying out. Overall a good purchase for the price.",1,1
"This case has been great. About 3 days after I had it, I dropped it on the ground. My external hard drive survived intact-- the case got a little tiny stuff but it did the job.  The strap to hold in the hard drive is smart and the pocket for the cords is a really great idea.  This case looks really slick and I love the red color.  How well do I like this case?  I like it so much that I will be buying another case in a different color.  You can't say fairer than that. Perfect, exactly as ordered Great product, great delivery! Good-for-me",1,1

"I really wanted to love this. I purchased to make it easier to grind up my MMJ.  Sent it back because it's just too flimsy to be effective for my needs. The blades really are like tin foil and no matter how small amount of MMJ I'd put in, it'd get hung up and just stop. It's a great idea poorly executed due to inferior materials. Too bad... Original review: I don't know about anybody else but mine worked just fine. Instructions that come with the grinder where easy to read and did say to use Triple-A batteries. The grinder did stall when trying to grind full bud but instructions say to break it down into smaller pieces anyway. All in all,  at $8 a great value. This little thing, is amazing, Just don't overload it or toss in stems. Kinda scary if you have to fix a clog on your own. But just don't go out trying to win a Darwin award with it. Little cap is secure, things are good. To be on safe side during a clog, simply take the batteries out of the butt end of this thing and it is smooth sailing. I put too much in the second time I used it, opened it, turned it on, and flung a hunk of product clear across the room dislodging it from the blade spinning at mach whatever speeds. This is totally fake news! DO NOT BUY IT!!! I just got mine yesterday and the grinder is way too weak, so it doesn't chop a thing, also after I tried to use it, it started to smell burned... Totally waste of time and money, plus I had to spend $15 because it was an international shipping, this product is GARBAGE! Wow I bought this thinking since it looks like a flashlight it wouldn't actually work all that well but boy was I wrong. It takes 3 triple A batteries not included but it works great. Has a lot of power. Definitely satisfied with this purchase. When there is nothing in the grinder it seems to work pretty good but when i tried actually using it. Overfilling it was not the only issue that i experienced. More than once during one of the uses did the blade get caught and forced me to open it and restart it. More of a novelty item in my opinion Great lil grinder! Amazed at how well made it is! Looks just like a flashlight when sat next to one. The blades are set a certain way to allow for a tornado like method to pull the herbs into the blade. Like how u can view the density of the herb as you grind so you don't make it too powdery or leave chunky. Very pleased with this product and cannot beat the price!",1,1

"Polaroid is the undisputed name associated with instant pictures so it is not surprise that they have come out with a compact and cute instant print version as their latest product. The Snap is just that, pictures in a snap. But there is a lot to know about this very simple camera. I'm very happy with this polaroid! I'm a really big fan of photography and cameras and I had been wanting an instant camera for a while. I finally bough this for my birthday to myself. First of all, I had some worries about the quality, I read so many reviews that were not convinced about this camera and I didn't know if I wanted to risk it, so here is what convinced me to buy it.",0,0

"I used to get these at W#*!@t but now I see they no longer carry my size, even on their web site.  A couple of online places sell them but just try to find one with a for-sure 2XL size link for ordering!  I tried a pack of these at Amazon to see if they really were 2XL's and how nasty the assorted colors were.  They arrived the correct size and the fabric seems to be what I'm used to.  Colors were light gray, (which is what I wanted), dark navy, (not bad), dark reddish-maroon, (tolerable), and bright green, (hideous).  Since they mostly are what I needed and I can't find them anywhere else, I pulled the trigger on FIVE more packs of 4.  They all came in the correct 2XL size and identical colors as the first one I ordered. these are not the boxers I was expecting to receive. I ordered the comfortsoft boxers. I received the comfortflex boxers in a ripped bag. there is a difference. this is the kind of material boxer I was trying to avoid getting because it's uncomfortable, too thin, not breathable, flexible or soft. shouts out to the mongoloids selling these for being incompetent. accidents do happen but these are not even the same style boxers I ordered. see in the picture I have attached how the waistband differs from the advertised boxers. certain things should just be bought in person I suppose. I can't be bothered to return these tbh so I'll just wear them angrily I ordered two packages of these for my son for Christmas and one package is perfect.  The second package, with the same style number, is totally different and does not fit well.  Of course, they cannot be returned because they are underwear that are open and have been tried on.  Quite the disappointment.  Two stars because the one set is perfect but 50/50 is not acceptable. The quality has really gone down hill. I bought these awhile ago from Walmart and they fit better and we're comfortable. So I decided to buy more from Amazon and the one I just got are the same size but fit much smaller and the elastic band is coming through the stitching, digging into my waist. Comfort waist my butt. What a waste of money. Same ones we buy in the store but for a big and talk guy they only hold up 4 to 6 months max. They ALWAYS wear thin on the inside of the legs and by 4 months huge holes.. basically becoming a giant skirt ... best part is the fabric wrapped band . Hanes must have a patent on that or not many others have caught on yet. Colors are not as pictured in the photograph. The photograph shows a red and a light blue pair along with some pairs in darker colors, but the actual colors that came are different shades of gray and either black or very dark blue. I have no issues with these boxers beyond that they arrived ahead of schedule and fit great, but the colors are likely not what I would have chosen if given a choice as I already received a pack of boxers in these exact colors for the holidays. I've used these underwear for years, but now they are sized too small. The fabric is also thinner and not all that soft. The best comfort feature used to be a wide elastic waistband, but now it is narrower and easily rolls-over which is annoying and not very comfortable. This was a nice product, and I would much rather they had increased the price and maintained quality. Now, I need to find another favorite underwear. So Hanes has decided to change the material that these are made from. ""Now even softer"" is not true. They are rough and scratchy. Second they also decided to change the cut of these. The ""pocket"" is way too small. The old style were very comfortable and soft. These are neither. I will be looking for a new manufacturer for my future underwear needs.",1,1
"Finally, an easy solution to rings that need to go over my knuckles but then are too large for the finger and result in the top of the ring twisting around so the top ends up facing the palm of my hand..  I like the variety of sizes that fit different thicknesses of rings and the easy on-off application. Not sure if they will serve my purpose as again I have osteroarthritis and big knuckle.  Either have to enlarge the ring to a size 11 where it is ugly looking  I want to put it back to a smaller size and leave the cut bottom open and put something that will protect my finger from the opening on the bottom.  Seeing a jeweler soon and maybe they will like these ring guards for others. They work great.",1,1
"I am really happy with this shirt I bought for my Grandson, It is very nice material feels super soft but holds it shape really well , You do need to be aware that the size runs very small , My grandson wears a medium in Usa but got an xxl in Asian size and it fits him perfect. I already knew that you need to order a few sizes bigger to fit USA sizes.  The colors are very black not washed out and it is sewed really well. He said he likes it very much and fits him comfortable. It has been washed one time and still looking good , did not have any shrinkage. The fit of this shirt is very good and looks good if you're reasonably fit. One issue... this shirt is much warmer than expected, and the fabric tends to retain odors. This means you'll sweat a lot and may smell like b.o. by the end of the day/evening. This is probably a better shirt for a casual, relaxed outing rather than a day at work or a summer concert. This is on me - there is a hole in the back, looks like the tag was ripped out and left a hole, but the tag is still there. I didn't get it returned in time, too much going on. We'll probably just donate it. We ordered a size larger and the width fit perfectly but the length is too short. I'm only 6ft and it barely touches my belt. Nice shirt, good quality other than length. my husband liked it, but i would not say the same. to me it looks cheap, but since he likes it, this is ok Omg my husband look so hot in this shirt. Great quality and colour combination. And size chart helped alot I love the new long sleeve shirt. I'm planning to get more in the future. Got this for a friend. I ordered a large after reading the reviews and he wears a medium. It might've been a little lose but he liked it. It was comfortable and looks great. Shipping was pretty fast and there was nothing that I can complain about or didn't like. So overall 5 star!",1,1

"There is a weird cloth band across the middle of the tie which causes it to pucker and not lay smoothly. I don't know if it's meant to lend some fashion interest but for me it ruins the lines of the tie. Maybe the vendor can explain what it's there for. Was also too expensive for what it is (not silk). I ordered this tie for my bridesman, after the other Original Penguin tie I ordered was actually red and not pink. Both are labeled pink but this one is a great baby pink. It was perfect and arrived just in time.",1,1
"I received this product today and it is adorable. It looks great and takes the place of my REAL wedding band for work. I love it. I got it quicker than I was supposed to. This is awesome! I just received this today, and have already gotten 2 compliments on it! The fit is pretty true to size, and is perfect for a small hand like mine (size 5). Finally received item in the mail only to find out it was shipped without the middle stone. Very dissatisfied. I absolutely love this ring! It very delicate looking and looks beautiful on my finger I was a little worried because of the price but you would never guess it was as inexpensive as it is. My experience with this product has been wonderful. I originally purchased the wrong size and upon submitting to return it, they reached out to me asking what size I needed and sent me the correct size for free! I couldn't be happier with this product. I definitely recommend this to anyone considering the ring. The sizing is very true to size, I just wasn't sure what size I was. If you don't know, go to a jeweler and get sized, the charts you find online to size yourself do not work and i was 2 sizes off! lol I've had it over a week hasn't changed colors yet, I rarely take it off.. Sleep with it shower with it. It's small but tasteful can't complain for what I paid.. Fits perfect, I am more then happy with the ring!! Came in earlier than expected. The ring is beautiful but the cubic zirconia is a little smaller than I thought it would be. Nonetheless, the ring is perfect for what I paid for. Nice however it looks smaller than the picture. It is hard to see any of the details in the ring. ... Just kidding, I would never propose with this.",1,1
"This drive is the best I have ever purchased and I am now spoiled on nvme drives. Installation was a breeze and no cables to cram in behind my case either. Windows 7 came out a long time ago and does not have built-in support/drivers for NVMe drives in general (not a samsung issue, but a windows 7 issue).  If you are using windows 8/10, you will not experience the driver issues. This is a review of the Samsung 960 EVO 250GB M.2 SSD Drive. I'm not sure what to do anymore. My usual gaming ritual of booting up Doom or The Witcher 3 and going to get something to drink while the level loads seems so unnecessary now. It just loads almost instantly so I never have to leave my chair. My pee is dark brown now. Thanks, Samsung.",0,0
"I purchased these stunning boots after I saw my Dance teacher wearing a similar pair (Tootsie) last year and absolutely fell head over heels in love. I found them on DSW, but for $69.99 came here and found these that are still cute. While happy with my purchase. without the reviews saying they run small they would have been way too tight. I'm a size 7.5 but went a size up to 8 and they fit, but are still snug at the pinky toe, probably because of the shape of the shoe. They unfortunately only came in wide calf and my calves are pretty skinny. Still really satisfied and I'm keeping them. Boot is awesome wide calf is NOT wide calf. It has 1/2 inch of expansion room. Decent boot. But if you're like me and have wide feet, this didn't work. I love Fergi boots and probably have 8 or 9 pairs. This is the first pair I've put on that was too narrow in the toe for me. I do have trouble with other brands too, so if you have normal feet these probably work well. I have to wear brands like Guess, Fergalicious and White Mountain to get them wide enough for me. Otherwise they looked like the same quality as all my other Fergi boots. Sad they didn't fit me correctly. After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about buying these boots but I went ahead and took the leap. I am so glad I did. These boots are fabulous and they look as good as they feel. They fit true to size. I highly recommend them. Love the boots . They are comfortable and look great. However I’m not impressed with the quality. Right out of the box I noticed one of the straps that goes around the heel is already coming apart. Disappointed considering they are brand new and I liked them otherwise I really wanted to love these boots but I felt they were slightly shiny. I didnt like the look they gave me so I returned them. A note to anyone on sizing... I felt confident in ordering my ALWAYS 7.5. I have owned Fergalicious boots before that were a 7.5 and they were perfect. These were sooo tight. I needed an 8 without a doubt. I also feel like this brand has declinded in quality. The boots felt cheap compared to the previous boots I have owned from this line. I love these boots. They dont have that leather shine that makes them look fake and they are so comfortable I gave 4 stars because I went up a size and its still too tight. (thinking of getting the foot stretched by cobbler) I do have a wide foot, but this is a very narrow boot. the wide calf part gives me more than enough room though. The color and style is gorgeous. they are worth keeping.",1,1
"I followed their size chart and the other reviews to pick a size. I usually wear a 7-7.5 and bought the 6.5 in this brand. It's a good fit, a bit loose but never in danger of slipping off. They look adorable, they're comfortable and I've gotten tons of comments. Usually things like, ""I didn't know they made jellies for adults!"" which I choose to take as a compliment. I like that it's got a fabric liner rather than the plastic bottom I remember from childhood. Wore these with white footie socks.  Tried barefoot and even though these are a lot more pliable than the jelly shoes of my childhood, that familiar jelly shoe pain was real.  I actually like how they look on my feet with the footies on though and it wasn't noticeable at all.  Bought for my wedding, but I've worn them several times after.  Very comfortable. These were comfortable and looked great! Very unique.  They were however VERY stinky when they arrived.  I left them to air out for a week before I wore them at a wedding.  I would not suggest planning on wearing these right out if the package because you will smell bad.  Otherwise, very happy with them! The color is pretty and its strong and flexible. Ive been searching a few weeks now for a actual comfortable slip on flat, that will stay on. It seems like, based on how solid the bottom and nest appears, that this will last a long time. I love these. Cute as they look online and fit as expected. I throw these on to run to the store or do a quick errand. I've already had a few compliments too. I bought them to walk along the ocean/sand but I do 6 miles and I'm not sure they would be that comfortable if they got wet. I'll try to it out and let you know. Wow, So comfortable, so cute. I was not super into them but they fit a purpose. Once I received them tho... I fell in love. Adorbes. I got them for a trip and have not worn them for any real walking yet but I am confident they will be awesome. I bought them for an Elsa costume that I'll be wearing for my niece's birthday party, but I may just wear them more often than expected. They are super cute and comfortable. The smell is there, but there is a warning about it and it's not like it'll last forever. Love love love these shoes! So cute and sparkly! They saved my feet during my husband's Christmas party. I have worn them to every formal party since. Yes, they are not heels, but I like my feet not to be in pain.",1,1

"What they sent is NOT what they show. The classic in the purple box has a much better flavor than the Earl Grey in the light tan box. It's okay and pleasant. I know the difference because my son brings me the purple boxed Twinnings Earl Grey from England, which has a much better flavor. I thought finally, they had made this variety available in America so I don't have to have my son stock pile it for me. Wrong. What I ordered is not what I got. The tan colored Earl Grey would get 3 stars (it's okay), but the it's disappointing when the Purple Box (and the stronger tea inside) is not what they send.. I'm keeping it because I make iced tea with it. Last year I gave up all carbonated beverages and all caffeine. Since I find juices and sports drinks too acidic, that left me with milk and water to drink. After a while I was longing for something different, and I surely missed my sweet tea. On a whim I bought a box of Twinnings Rooibos from the local grocery store one day. Wow! What a great tea! We love Earl Grey tea. We drink quite a bit of it, hence ordering 100 Bags at once. We have had a few different brands of Earl Grey, and there's a couple things that set Twinings apart from their more affordable competition. EDIT: I've found that this tea is much more enjoyable if I drink it cold. What I simply do is just brew a cup as I'd normally do but let it cool. I then dump it in my water jug that has one packet of True Lime and one slice of lemon already in it. This is my favorite cold tea, ever!  Brewed tea can be strong if not brewed properly but cold brew tea is a snap and perfect everytime!  I love that I don't have to sweeten this tea because it has a hint of citrus in the bag.  I also found that you can't over brew this tea.  I put it in a large jar to brew the night before and it is ready when I want it in the morning.  Some days it sits in the refrigerator with the tea bags still in the jar and taste wonderful!  Love this tea! Very mild flavor. No comparison with Bigelow brand. Like some others have already validated, there is very little flavor in these bags. In fact even two or three of these just cannot provide the color and flavor of one Bigelow.",1,1
"This is a healthier alternative to CHEX cheese snack mix. While still somewhat a salty carb bomb, it is good alternative the aforementioned product. The cheese flavor is yummy, it has a good crunch, and this snack is addictive. Be sure to portion out what you want to allow yourself or those you are serving. I'm hoping these are better when bought in store...I had them shipped to my house in Chandler, Arizona (bordering Phoenix) and they smelled completely rancid, my family couldn't even eat them. I'm guessing it had something to do with mailing in the heat...? I'm hoping, anyway. Otherwise, I have no idea why people would buy these. These are OK but I don't get all the fuss, these are not better than Goldfish at all. Actually they are more annoying because they are coated like a Cheetos or Doritoz is and the cheese comes off on your hands. As others have noted, it's pretty bland. You only get two types of crackers that taste identical and pretzels. Would definitely not purchase again. Delicious and doesn't make a mess with lots of small pieces or powder. Clean tasting not salty. Wish it had more pretzels. I wasn’t expecting the mixture to be covered in cheese dust. It would have been better without it. Fine snacking food. Not too salty. Coated with flavoring so your hands need cleaning after snacking. Overall good but not outstanding. Solid cheesy snack. Don't know what else to say. Munchies be gone!",1,1
"Awesome little boxer briefs for my son. He looks adorable and they have his initial on the leg. Too small These were awesome.  I thought my son would be dissapointed that they didn't have Superheroes, but turned out he loves them because they are COMFORTABLE.  They were the perfect size (he is tall and skinny), and are really good quality material. Material is nice, but way too small for the size ordered. My son is normally a size 12-14 and after a wash, he could not fit these. It may be the cut but they were way too small. Bummer very comfortable fits well and seems to be great quality as well looks like they will last a long time Great My grandson loves these briefs. They fit great and look cute. Nice briefs but size was small for the intended person",1,1
It fits my little guy but it is somewhat small. He may not even get a month’s use out of it. But they are really attractive These are just the cutest shoes ever! Good quality too. I can't wait until my little one can fit into these! Perfect shoes for the beach too.,1,1
Love the garter belt fits quite well. Arrived on time.,1,-1
"I bought these for an upcoming beach vacation. I did size up so there is a little extra room. I am not sure I needed to but the good news is they fit so well it doesn't matter.  They aren't like the walmart water shoes.  The tops are a very thin spandex type fabric.  We put them on and loved them.  Can't wait to use in Cancun!  (I bought 3 pairs - one for each of us) These make my feet feel so much safer walking around in pools beaches lakes etc where u can't totally see the bottom of the water....I have another pair similar to these there wonderful and make my feet feel so safe and there light weight and easy to drain water out of them.... I love these water shoes! They're super light weight, comfortable to wear and will keep my feet protected at the beach or the pool.  I love how vibrant the colors are. Best ones I've found in a long time and great price too. It felt like i was wearing nothing! Comfortable. I loved how bright and colorful they are. Nice non slip rubber soles. I didnt feel like i was going to slip even once. Felt like a 2nd skin. And a cute frog on the heel! They were super cute and comfortable. Ordered them for a trip to Jamaica because we wanted to climb waterfalls. Had to send them back because they were too small. A size up would've been perfect. I ordered these water socks in the size to match my shoe size. My toe reached the tip of the sock. I returned them and ordered a size up. Unfortunately the cost had increased $2.00. I like this water shoes so much, it has good quality, light weight , very convinient to cary it in your beach bag as they very light and so comfortable to wear it in the water! Good shoes for the pool, help a lot in slippery areas and keep you clean when you step into some areas. very light and comfortable.",1,1

"Just got this cute colorful table in today and absolutely love it. It was very easy to put together, only took maybe 20min to do. It's very sturdy too, unlike some of the other plastic table and chairs. I put mixed up the pieces of the chairs like another customer had done , cause I thought it was way cool looking. The kids enjoy it and have lots of room to do their coloring or playing on. My girl is 1 and my boy is 3 and both fit at it just fine. Would recommend anyone to buy this set for the price and quality. The table came in a lil' banged up and is too small for the age range (3-8). I don't think it is worth the price but I did turn it into something great! This table is really cute. At first, I was worried about the chairs not having enough back support but I noticed that my daughter rarely sits back. I've had various kids use the table and they all seem comfortable. The table looks really cute and the quality is good. The only problem I have is that it came chipped on one side of the table top, but I think I can just fill that in myself and it's fine. I got the matching bookcase and it's adorable. It's sturdy and easy to clean. My daughter has written on it with washable markers and it wiped off. She has also smeared blackberries at the table, which stain and they came right off. The price is also very good. I would definitely purchase this table again. Loved this table and my daughter loves it too. However the wood is warping after just 2 months. Very disappointed. Broke.  Not all wood - made of cardboard! Adorable table and chairs set, perfect for homeschooling my toddlers. It came with a few minor scratches and scrapes, but nothing that will stand out The table is wonderful. It was easy to assemble and seems sturdy. The color of the table is more orange than the natural wood color that the picture makes it appear, but I read previous reviews that said this and so it wasn't a huge deal for me, but would have preferred the natural wood. IT's cute and very colorful and my almost 2 year old loves it already. This is a great little table. Sturdy wood and a pretty white color. Was very happy to see it comes about 50% preassembled. For the most part, all you have to do is attach the legs. I can see that it will probably scratch up easily but it's a kids table and I reasonably expect that. I just got done putting it together so time will tell on how it will hold up but it seems sturdy now. Kids were excited and sat right away. I have newly 3 year old twins and they fit comfortably with room to grow.",1,1
"Very fast, my laptop would literally take 5 minutes to boot up to a usable state, with this 30 secs. However if you are  DOWNSIZING from a larger HDD to this, it is not straightforward, I have upgraded dozens of drives over the years, I don't claim to be an expert, but probably above average  in computer skills.  I had an awesomely slow 1TB drive on my laptop, way more storage than I needed. I took off extra stuff and got it to about 150gb, then  tried several clone/drive migration programs and none would work for some reason or another. I read online it is possible, but seemed complicated, and frankly I didn't want to pop extra money for a ""pro"" clone program, with no guarantees they would work, or get into system settings. I own an Apple iMac 5k with USB-C interfaces. I want to place all my important files in an external, encrypted SSD drive, something fast and compact where I can carry it with me during my travels. Conventional flash drive is out of the question because of their slow write speed, even the read speed is only about 150MBPS. A 2.5"" SSD is not compact enough given the frequent travel portability requirement. It looks like a M.2 NGFF SATA type SSD stick, coupled with a matching well made USB-C enclosure will fit the bill  This 85MB/s 64GB Micro SD comes with the full size adapter and formatted exFAT, with the final capacity of 60.5GB. This model that I purchased is the UHS speed class U1 standard, which is what the SD Association recommends for everything except 4K recording. For 4k recording, a card capable of 30MB/s or better write speeds is what you should purchase.",1,1
"Fits perfectly! I had heads turning. I am a 36C. I sometimes wear a large and an extra large depending on what it is. I got a xxxl. I weigh 195. I hope this review helped. This is my first high waisted swimsuit I have ever bought and I'm so glad I did! I'm 5'3 and 180lbs, I followed the size description and bought the 3xl and it fits perfectly. The bottoms can go high or be pushed down to whatever the preference is. Hope this review & pictures helps others. I am 5'9"" and 185lbs my breast size is a 38DDD I bought a XXL. The bottom is a little higher than expected. I got the order fast in 2 days and it is good quality.  The best swimsuit I've had in years and it was affordable. I am a mother of 5, so i have some stomach issues as far as weight goes. However this swimsuit made me feel amazing sexy, it was ie being mommy with a twist... I love this! I gained a lot of weight in the last year or so because of medical reasons, and have been been very self conscious. I've been trying to find a suit that covers what I don't like while still letting me feel sexy and not like a grandma. I chose an XXL after reading reviews. I am 5'2"", 185 lbs, and a 36DDD. I probably could have gone with another size up, because there's not very much coverage for the girls. I hope my review helps! To my curvy thick ladies this baithig suit is an absolute must!!! I am about to  buy it in every color it so perfect! The quality feels super expensive the color is vibrant and just straight out stunning. This is my 2nd review on a different color.  I ordered a Large again since I'm prego and the old one fits perfect while I'm prego and loose while I'm not (but tight in legs).  I am 5'8"" and my pre-Prego size is an 8.  In the blue color it's a little snugger in the body and I don't have very much more room to stretch the bottom for my bump like I still do with the other one, but at least the top fits much much better in the blue and is not set apart as much as the tan.  Below is a picture of both swimsuits in the exact same size, just different body shapes.  This is way cute for maternity and I give it 5 stars on that front, but the tan one remains 3 stars, so average is 4 stars for both I love this bikini! The material is great, the sizing was good, and the shipping was quick. It arrived a day sooner than it was supposed to. I wear a 34/36B and usually a medium in bottoms so I went ahead and just bought a medium. It fits very well, the top covers everything while still giving off slight cleavage but my breasts won't bounce out. I definitely recommend this!",1,1

"This was purchased as a gift for my wife... under the assumption it would be used for wires and cables and other electronic stuff. I travel on business quite a bit and need to take various electronics with me (I also repair hardware servers) and over the years my laptop bag has become a jumble of various bits and pieces that I need. I finally decided after this last trip to Africa I had to get better organized. So I purchased this roll-up case as one of the three possible solutions (which means I also bought two other cases of different styles). I like this case as it hold a bunch of stuff securely and rolls up into a neat package. I also put my Tile bluetooth tracker in it so it also serves a purpose for finding my bag if I get disconnected from it. All in all a neat bag that has good quality construction and I can recommend this if you're looking to neaten up your electronics. Very good value. We travel with a lot of devices and the cords are usually a mess in the backpack. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. It has a pocket and belt for just about everything. My only regret is that I should have purchased this earlier. Keeps cords and batteries well organized. Highly recommend this product I finally had the opportunity to test drive this bag on a short driving trip last weekend. A major drawback to it, in my opinion, is it is a tad too small to deal with the Apple laptop cord (the white square and the power cord combo.) I can get it zipped up but it is a real struggle trying to get the power cord in a pocket. With the power cord and square in there, plus a portable Bluetooth mouse it does not lay flat as shown in the Amazon photo. See my photos. This is for small electronics' cords - phones and tablets. Thumbdrive pockets would probably hold but I would use the zippered pockets for thumbdrives. If you're like most poeple, you have a lot of devices and wires to charge them. If you're like me, you're always losing them or have them break in your bag. UPDATE AGAIN: After the company read my review they contacted me, asked me for some details, and then provided a new roll-up. I certainly would give this company 5 Stars, and if this one doesn't separate as the earlier one did, I will come back here and upgrade my review. This is exactly what I was looking for.  I can add/subtract stuff and it gets thicker or thinner.  I love that it isn't some zippered thing that may or may not result in the zipper breaking if it's too full of stuff.",1,1
"Very scretchy and would fit about any size. Decent quality. Only complaint is that it has a tendency to roll due to the width and flexibility when you sit down. Still very cute with about any color. Nice! It makes loose, casual dresses look sexy. It snaps in back, and if it's tight, you can always loosen the laces a bit. It looks good think I  should have went down a size though. It's really nicely made. Very stretchy, very comfotable. But it had this very punget musty smell. Like old carrots that were left to mold in the fride. I washed it foir times, left it outside to air out but it still smells. Actually decently made. Elastic is good and looks sube cute over a renaissance gown.",1,1
Very poor delivery speed. Ordered on 18 Nov and received goods on 18 Dec. One month to receive!!! Misleading advertisement by seller. Photos in advertisement shows remote control and tripod stand but did not send me these items. Feel cheated! Send them messages to ask and they didn’t reply,-1,-1
"I've been using this detergent for a few years now and while I like the Eco friendly aspect I'm not sure it's really a great product. It smells highly of bleach (but many dishwashing liquids do), and has begun leaving residue all over the soap compartment in my dishwasher. We started using this the other day and it consistently leaves a white film/residue on all of our dishes. I've tried using less of the product and running a rinse cycle after a load but achieve the same result. Very unhappy with the product. This is the only dishwasher detergent to get rid of tea stains. I can't find it anywhere locally so I resorted to buying it here. I would rather have 1 big bottle than the 3 little ones personally. I have used this stuff for years. I think I started buying it in my college days because it was the cheapest liquid on the market. Now, I still buy it because it is ""safe"" for the steams and lakes (I live in a watershed, so I pretend to care about these things when they fit in my budget). Speaking of, I was feeling a little guilty about spending money on detergents and so I was testing out some eco-friendly-make-at-home-solutions.... that was a failure! If people complain about white film on things from Palmolive, they didn't see what happened with this home-made solution! Also, I have tried other green products and ended up tossing them because I prefer to have my spoons and bowls come out clean after a wash cycle... I thought at first this was a real good buy, it ended up not being so.  This dishwasher detergent doesn't completely dissolve in the dishwasher, my son is now trying to get the slug out of the dishwasher, he has been working on it over an hour, I fear it has ruined the dishwasher.  It was so backed up after using for just a few months that the dishwasher will not drain.  I will NOT buy again, and if you use this, I suggest that you  watch the dishwasher closely for this same issue. Best value for your money and it's eco friendly. I have used the eco brand for many years.. it is affordable high quality decent for the environment and still cleans well. I have since moved towards seventh generation myself but this is a better number if you want to get an environmentally sound option. I feel like this is one step below the quality of the expensive pods, but I have to pre-wash things anyway and this just becomes a sanitizing phase. For what it's worth, you get a bunch of suds for cheap. I'd recommend this, and keep in mind your dishwasher isn't going to remove grime from that plate you left under your couch for a month either way.",1,1
"I wore this beach cover-up as a regular outfit, over a plain black dress.  I love the tiny tassels around the edges, it is perfect for this year's trend, and very cute!  I am 5'2"", and 118 pounds.  I found the fit to be very comfortable, since it is so loose on me.  Since the side are open, this is cute if worn with shorts, a skirt, etc.  I am also looking forward to using it as an actual cover-up.  The only thing I would change is to make the tassels not stick together as much as they do. Great value for the price!! Super cute for TWO or THREE wears. It is NOT going to hold up through the washing machine so don't even try it!  It is sheer, so you can see your bathing suit through it a little bit (which I think is perfect for poolside!).  Going to buy another in a different color! 😊 Loved this cover I used it as a top with some shorts and it was great! I bought this for a recent trip to Hawaii and I got a lot of compliments on it! Highly recommend you purchase this cover up! SUPER cute and simple! Exactly what I was looking for! For the price it's adorable and quality acceptable.  I'm 5'-7"", 150 lbs with short torso and 36DD bust.  The cover-up hits me almost mid thigh (like a tunic) and is pretty narrow overall but that's great b/c most cover-ups like these make me look like I'm wearing a tent. I really loved using this as a bathing suit cover. It works great, though a bit see-through. I didn't get burned under it, but I also applied a bunch of sunscreen so I am not sure if it helps with the sun exposure. It is very roomy but that' how it should be.  Very pretty and light.  See through (back especially) but wear this on top of the bathing suite covers nicely. I'm 5'5"" 120LB-ish.  Very very roomy and that's what I like about it.  Anytime soon, planning on new colors?  I'd love to have pink and orange!! This is an awesome cover up.  Based on how it looks in the pic, I was almost expecting it to be on the small side, so I say it is somewhat large because I feel like it is bigger than it looks in the pic.  However, it is a super comfy, lightweight cover up and looks fabulous!  In fact I wore it to sit poolside yesterday and my friend loved it so much that I ordered another one in a different color while we were sitting at the pool:)",1,1
"I was debating whether to purchase this Vtech toy remote control over the Fisher-Price one and ultimately what swayed me was the color and look of this one--the remote controls we happen to have in our house, that my eight month old son loves to grab and play with at any chance, are all black, whereas the Fisher-Price remote is gray.  I wanted one that was as similar as possible to our ""real"" remotes. At first my 1 year old fell for this. We bought it as a decoy so he’d stop stealing the real tv remote. It worked for maybe a week. He quickly caught on. Now he’s back to stealing our remote and this thing will soon be on its way to Goodwill, because the song is SO OBNOXIOUS. “Gather round to pretend it’s time to watch a tv show with your friends”... “so many shows to watch, so little time!” Yes I’ve memorized it. It plays over and over and it makes me cringe. It seems like it’s trying to brainwash my child to be addicted to the tv. Not a winner. My 9 month old son loves it. He is always interested in TV remote control and cellphones, he grabs it from my hand. I pretend that I hold it like a real remote control and he grabs it. I accidentally dropped it on the floor and it is still working . The volume is loud enough for the infant to hear. There are two control for the volume. I wish I didn’t buy this toy. The voice on this toy is SOOOO annoying. I still give it to my daughter to play with, although she doesn’t really pay any attention to it. It doesn’t seem to captivate her attention. I’m a little disappointed of how boring the toy is. I thought it would do more. She still prefers the real remote control (with no batteries in it) over this one, which defeats the point in buying this toy. I wanted her to NOT play with the real remote control. This toy is such a huge hit in the one day that we've owned it that my 4 year old keeps sneaking it out of my baby's pack n play to press all the buttons. She's too old for this kind of toy but seems to love ALL the different options for noise that this thing makes.  My son is 7 months old and unbelievably prefers this fake remote to the 2 real ones we use in our living room that he darts after every time he sees them. The kids start out young with technology today, haha. My 10 months old son loves playing with remote controls for our TV & cable. So I bought this hoping he would play with it instead of constantly changing channels, muting and voluming up to the max. He was interested in this in the beginning but it didn't hold his attention for long... He would rather play with real remotes, still. I think all the babies who love playing with remote controls are fascinated by buttons first, then eventually figure and become interested in what they do to TV. Babies also can tell the difference between toys that are allowed for them to play with and things that only adults use. So if you are looking for a substitute of a real remote like I was, I don't recommend this one. I gave him a remote with no batteries in that we no longer use. He loves it more than this toy. This is a great little toy. It's sturdy and the songs/ tunes it plays aren't the typical type annoying ones. It actually plays some catchy little songs. Not the best but catchy ex: ""Gather around to pretend we're going to enjoy TV shows with some friends"" it says the numbers that are being pushed,  pretty clearly. My 9 month  old will play with it from time to time buy she doesn't like it as much as some of her other toys. It is great but also limited functions. Something strange is that when pushing certain buttons on this pretend remote another ""V-Tech"" toy that didn't come with this one will start to go off. It is really a little crazy. I'm not sure how that happens. This remote has two volume settings and it has flashing lights when the music is playing. All in all, it's good for the price :) My 8 month old daughter was always stealing our remote and playing with it (and our phones) so I decided to get her her own remote. I swear, this thing is absolutely worth it's weight in gold now. Lol other than the fact the default song will get stuck in your brain and you'll wanna drop kick it, its great. But, I'm pretty sure that's the case with any singing child's toy. Anyway, my daughter absolutely loves the flashing lights and sounds. Plus... She no longer reaches for our remote.",1,1

"Works okay(read:not good, but it works) for archiving data off old IDE drives at work.  Start with the drive and IDE/SATA adapter unplugged from everything and your AC brick plugged into the wall(with the power switch near the 4 pin molex set to OFF).  Make sure your drive has it's jumper set to master.  I build a lot of computers and servers and fix a lot of systems for my family and friends. Having good computer trouble shooting tools is a real benefit when trying to solve problems.  If you have to back up somebody's boot drive in an effort to save their operating system this kit is always a good thing to have. It is also nice to be able to back up their files. This USB 2.0 converter allows you to attach SATA and IDE storage devices to your computer in order to test their hardware or to try to save their files. This product has a lot of 4+ stars and it was recommended by an IT friend. However, I give these 2-Stars only because I think the issue is with a MFR batch that should have been recalled- not the actual product. The power connectors won't go together for 2 reasons: the molded end is slightly too big, the #3 hole was too closed up, and the pins are loose and don't line up really well. This creates an issue of the pins pushing out and/or cocking sidewise in the connector. (Look at the 1-star reviews). The other reason for 2-Stars is that when I called customer service to discuss the problem, the rep was immediately on the offensive and tried to blame it on me. This was telling that it wasn’t the first they heard of this particular complaint. In what should be the worst reason for the poor workmanship, he had stated it didn't matter if all the pins went in or plug fit together, because I didn't need all of them to supply power. Way to stand behind your product, defects and all. Unfortunately the ones I needed wouldn't make contact. I was trying to get help or a replacement part and his final response was return it if I wasn't happy. So here you go. This works exactly as it said. I had an older version  that did not work with Windows 10. This one works fine on Windows 10. Also it did not show the 120 Volt power supply in the picture or say anything about it. It does come with the 120 Volt power supply in case anybody wants to know. Service and delivery were great. I will add a picture of what came in the box.",1,1

"Nice looking and well priced. I had to return them the moment I rec'd because I could not even fit my foot half-way. There is a thick insole which I tried removing to make room for my feet, but even that was not sufficient. I think it will fit most people with average-width feet, especially in the nore common size ranges. If you are comfortable in, say, Converse 13 you will find these very tight. At around 15.00$ a pair they’re okay for causal wear. Trip to market etc.  Can look really man-made but the color of this model(brown/tan) tones down the artificial appearance.  They’re not leather but I’m not ruining a 85.00 dollar boat shoe just for ever day nonsense.  This way my higher price shoes stay fresh for lookin causal not seedy. The sizing is my reason for 3 starts. Can't know how it feels or wears if I cannot get it in the right size. I will return and try this in a size smaller hoping it will fit my husband! Nice shoe, especially for the price. It is probably sized correctly, unlike others I tried, so the sizing is not likely the fault of the manufacturer. a cheap shoe... Price is probably high for the quality of the product...  Size is quite narrow and not at all what I expected...  Should have known from the low price that it was exactly that... A cheap imitation and not an attractive or comfortable one at that... Seem just a tad long for 10.5 size, but OK and comfortable. Wife says they make my feet look too long, but I've measured them against my previous pair of size 10 Dockers and the length difference is negligible. I like them and am considering buying another pair in a lighter color soon. Good price. Haven't worn them enough to determine their lifespan. But they fit well and for the price can't be beat. I think you will need to put some sort of insole as they are a bit light in this department. Otherwise, go for it! Arrived promptly, but the 8.5 D was extremely narrow, so narrow I couldn't even get the shoe on. These shoes aren't bad but they aren't great either. They're very soft, almost feel like slippers. No noticable arch support. I added arch supports. That said, you shouldn't expect a hundred dollar pair of shoes for twenty three dollars, so I'm pleased with the purchase.",1,1

"Perfect fit when you go up a size from regular clothes.  I wear a 8/10 normaly and ordered a large 12/14.  Quality is excellent and color is what is shown.  I was truly surprised and very happy with this purchase.  Very cute suit with good toroso coverage for a person over 60.  I ordered another in another color I was so happy and pleased. I’ve had 4 kids and 3 csections, I went on a cruise 9mos after my last baby was born and wasn’t sure what I would do about a swimsuit. this suit was perfect coverage for my stomach and awesome support and just enough cup shaping for bust area. easy to nurse in. I love it. I generally hate myself in bathing suits, it's why I rarely go to the beach...which is a shame because I live in the tropics! But this suit has changed my opinion! For reference, I'm 5'11"", around 160 pounds, give or take a couple, and I have a bit of a mummy belly (diastasis recti). I bought the large and the fit is absolutely perfect...i look exactly like the model in the photo! Lol, kidding, but I do look awesome in it! Gonna get another one asap! Love the quality of the material as well! I am so glad I decided to order a size up for this bathing suit! For the most part it fits great and I can't wait to wear it. I LOVE the top, it fits great and almost looks like a cute tanktop I could wear with a pair of shorts.  It is a simple black and white bathing suit, very pretty, and true to the color and design as advertised. The material is thick and feels durable and like it will last me a while. This is perfect for wearing around a water park or amusement park, and I'm excited to do just that! Great swimsuit! Love the color and design- the back has a great Razorback design and is oh so comfortable! The material is really soft and not stiff at all like some swimsuits. It is true to size. Can’t wait for the beach! I bought it as a gift for somebody who lived out of state. Did not fit them, and I just got it back from them a month later - well, the ""return window"" has closed so I am stuck with a swim suit that doesn't work for anybody. I can't even do an exchange at this point. Very frustrating and had I known I would not have purchased in the first place. Most vendors have a 60 or 90 day return policy. The top fit fine, but it comes with a bikini bottom, which I could not use. I liked this swimsuit just wasn't flattering when I tried it on. Too small.",1,1
"Beautiful, sturdy, elegant glassware for every day use! After one year, using Kinetico Softened water, a Bosch dishwasher, and Finish dishwashing detergent, these glasses have deteriorated to the point that they always look dirty/scratched.  I compare them to glasses purchased > 20 years ago and the older glasses have held up better, even though they were washed in military housing for years. These are good glasses that look nice, are sturdy, go through the dishwasher well without spotting and are flat on the bottom so they don't pool water!  I had bought some similar at Target many years ago and wanted to get some that were close to a match for those I had left.  These were very close.  I like these better! Great size and colors for kids.  We went with these to get away from plastic.  They have held up well, except they are coated with something on the outside that is peeling off. I like these glasses, and would recommend to purchase if you are looking for cheaper better quality glasses. They feel good in the hand, aren't just plain design, and fit perfectly on my shelf. I have been looking for some bright colored glasses to add some fun at the dinner table and have had a surprisingly hard time finding what I want.  I think these fit the bill.  I like that the texture is inside the glass and the outsides/insides are smooth (aka easy to clean).  The glasses are nice and heavy/solid, but not clunky looking - they have good balance to them.  The colors are deep (not translucent as you might expect from the picture) but when the light hits them they look very bright.  Other than the depth of the color the product picture depicts the colors fairly well with the exception of the light blue/green looking one.  It is much more of a teal in person.  Only time will tell how well they hold up to the dishwasher.  The box says hand wash only, but that's just not going to happen - I have my fingers crossed they hold up. :) UPDATE TO THE UPDATE - These are much higher quality than I was expecting for the price! I bought them for my daughter because she was constantly filling our regular 16 oz drinking glasses to the brim, taking a few sips, and leaving the rest of the water to eventually be poured out. Now she drinks most of the water she pours for herself. I find myself using them now too because they are so nice. Heavy weight, and the colors are beautiful. Wash very nicely in the dishwasher.",1,1
These were very adorable shoes but they didn't last very long for my little boy since he was always on the go. The soles were cloth so they got destroyed pretty fast. I think these shoes are ok for tiny babies not for kids that are walking. Overall.  Shoes look great. Love the material and style . These are not accurately sized by US standards or a size 3 should have fit. These are more like a size 1 rather than a size 3. Will most likely be sending them back. They are cute shoes but they fall apart easily. We just received them yesterday and they are already falling apart. These are great! Wide enough and the perfect size. Also super adorable. SO small!! :) super cute shoes. But this pair was the smallest ones and they were all the same size,1,1
"You probably haven't unlocked this packages greatest feature. I was excited at the idea of getting a variety of snacks each month.  The box it comes in is wonderful and I am repurposing the box as a storage for my classroom, but some of the snacks just don't get eaten. (I kept ordering it longer than I probably should have just because I liked the box.)  No one seems to like the 180 snacks or the honey almonds that come every month.  Some months there are substitutions, which I appreciate, but if you are expecting the same thing as listed in the description, it is not always exact. But all 6 of the boxes we have received had those 180 snacks and honey almonds. I've been attempting to eat healthier for over a year, and these care packages are an excellent way to stay on track. To keep myself from eating fast food after getting off work, I take one or two snacks from the box and eat them to kick my fast food habit. It's been working extremely well. I purchased two of these and sent them to my nieces and nephews (two different states) as an alternative to Easter candy.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how well received these snacks were!  In fact, my 16 year old nephew said ""you always give us the best Easter treats!"".  This will definitely be in consideration for future surprises for my kiddos.  :) Wonderful product to sen to friends in other states or in college. Very good large wide variety healthy snacks of good quality. I ordered a second for my mother and anticipate ordering another.  I've been recently been diagnosed with Type II diabetes and snack pack usually contain less than 8g of sugar.  My mother liked hers too.  Also, I liked the variety! Healthy snacks for my office is exactly what I want for my staff. There is a nice selection of snacks with lower calorie counts.",1,1
Good product quality Not bad,1,1
"I've been searching far and wide for a headset that provides both noise cancelling for listening as well as an excellent noise-cancelling microphone. I'd tried many products without success due to loud background noise at Starbucks being picked up by the mic. I hadn't heard of BlueParrott until I noticed a fellow patron using a one eared model. She said it did a good job of blocking out all the noise. After some research, I found this new headset. What I wanted: My husband is a truck driver and the sound barrier on these is awesome! Definitely worth the money. Oh my goodness gracious this Bluetooth headset is absolutely gorgeous and easily install. Wow seriously what a gorgeous beautiful surrounded stereo system headphones! Wow gorgeous beautiful sound and absolutely, absolutely extremely comfortable to wear. I made a few phone calls while I was driving and everything was absolutely perfect. Everyone I called and who called me told me they couldn't believe I was completely talking to them on a Bluetooth headset. They all said I sounded like I was in the next room. The clearity is perfect. Oh yeah did I mention lessoning to Pandora was actually absolutely perfect! Wow seriously impressed. I am so happy I didn't pay attention to the negatives of testimonials​and made my own final decision to purchase this Bluetooth headset because it's absolutely gorgeous and beautiful perfect sound and extrodanary comfortable. Thank you Amazon for caring this product because they are selling this in Truck Stops​for way, way more $$$ money! I'm so grateful for Amazon and the positive testimonials. Thank you. Thank you. Please. P.S. watching movies on Amazon and Netflix the stereo surround sound Bluetooth headset is absolutely superb sounds like you're inside of a movie theater with speakers completely surrounding you.. Totally awesome! Totally awesome I'm so grateful I didn't read into the negative testimonials and I made my own decision to purchase this Bluetooth headset. Wow seriously gorgeous beautiful sound! charged for 4 hours and still can't turn it on... (update) plugged car charger to my phone, showing 1200mh which is great, but my battery percentage is going down, which means its not charging even though it's showing good voltage, that's weird, I've never seen that happen, must be a bad charger... Going to try with another charger, I'll update.... Great sound, connects with bluetooth perfect. It is a good product overall.  However, it can be flimsy.  The rubber lining came loose after 2 months. I had my frame snap in two pieces after 6 months.  Also, the connection needed to be rebooted about a dozen times",1,1
The CPU came as advertised and was well built. Delivery was quick and seller was responsive to my queries. Would highly recommend for its value for money. Arrived on time and in good condition. Is it possible to upgrade to I-core 7? Good! Fast and good currently,1,1
"I saw a photograph a few weeks ago of a woman wearing a cloche bowler hat; I noticed how, though only a portion of her face was revealed, her eyes became the object of focus and also her skin. The hat itself flattered her face. Yes, she was beautiful, but what might such a hat do for me, a woman of 77 years, with the wrinkles that living those years have produced. I love the hat and put it on to go outside in a gentle sprinkle on a cold day. My head was warm, cradled by the hat, and I wore a warm jacket. I'm adding a photo. You can see my wrinkles, highlit by sun, but the hat draws attention to my eyes. I love this hat!  It is warm and well made.  I get a lot of compliments on it.  It has just enough stretch. I wish these great felt hats had an adjustable band or something inside. Or the company offered a smaller size. Thick material, good size, vibrant color. Buy this hat!!! I felt a bit risky buying a no-name hat off Amazon, but I was nicely surprised, it's a nice hat! It's crushable as it says, comes back to the same shape when you put it on your head. It is a bit big, I have maybe a medium-large head (I think my proper hat size is 7 1/4 but I can't remember, been a while since I had to have a properly sized hat!) and I kinda like how it falls down over your ears more. I think the bow over one ear looks fantastic (asymmetry is always better in a hat I think, since faces are asymmetrical) but you can also wear the bow to the back if you want and it looks just as it should. I like the color and the rolled side brim very much. The quality is good, but it's definitely not high-end at this price. I have a large head and was afraid the hat would be snug for me but it's loose. A person with a small head would probably not be happy with it. Very comfortable and super cute = I am not a hat person, but wanted a hat to wear in the mountains during our vacation.  This is much more elegant and cuter than a beanie.  Light weight for our Arizona cool weather.  Love it...just ordered another one for my sister.. Super Cute! I'm sensitive to wool so was leery to purchase this hat!",1,1
"The luxury chronograph watch with steel waterproof was stunning. Won't go wrong with the price and the quality of item. Love to buy another style. A perfect watch!! High quality! I like the blue color of the dial. And the stainless steel feels good. I already used it for couple days. Everything is nice. It runs accurately. And I look cool with this watch. Lol The design looks great. It is water resistant but don't swim with it . Beautiful watch, affordable price! I loves it! This watch looks very pretty and elegant, just as pictured. bought it for my husband. He loves it. REALLY NICE WATCH FOR THE PRICE LINKS WHERE EASY TO RMOVE FITS GREAT!! it comes in the very nice box, definitely good to use it as gift. when i open it i see a tool that use to adjust the watch band, i was pleased with this tool, since i always have to change the band smaller. the only thing that i prefer will be if the watch itself could be thinner, however, overall i like this watch. cool,nice men watch.it's not the best one but works great and enough for me.it fits perfectly.but when you receive it,you need to adjust the size by yourself.but very easy. Decent quality, but why package it with tape all around it? I opened it to look at it before gifting and it tore the box up and now it looks awful.",1,1
"They look and feel like the pints you would find at your local pub.  Only issue which caused a star deduction was the inconsistencies in the quality of the glass which you can see when looking through the bottom of the glass.  Most are nice and clear but a few have a permanent foggy look. Glasses are excellent quality, arrived in a shrink-wrapped set of 2 boxes (10 glasses each) without a scratch on them! Both of the two boxes I ordered were well package and contents were unbroken. Glasses are just as I expected. Your basic 16 oz pint glass. Glass is nice and uniform throughout with a nicely weighted bottom. Will buy again, i love these cups! We destroyed so many glasses, that we bought right away a set of 40! And it was a great idea! I dropped a Glas the other day on the hardwood floor and it did not shatter! They are exactly as described. Very happy. Finally glasses for adults! No tiny cups that fill two sips of water. The set I received have a faint purple hew to them.",1,1
"Good product quality Excellent service by seller Great product quality! But disappointed by the poor coordination for the collection.. Agreed at City Hall, seller changed at last minute when I was already there and asked if I could self collect at Tampines, agreed and was changed again to their office nearby. Expected better from them :/  Fast delivery",1,1
Surpassed all my expectations.  This is one very impressive and fast little machine.,1,0
"Good quality well-made Looks soooo real. The material is just perfect. I don't think you can find anything better for that price. Nice Better than I thought Wow, best quality",1,1
"Great set of mastic frames. I live to wear these when at a bookstore to appear smarter and pretend like I'm deep in thought. These are great! Way better than what I expected for the price. They go well with everything. I really like that they adjust to your head really well. Now I'm not scared of letting my friends try them on and making them loose. These were really cute, used them for a costume! They werent really super oversized like the product claims in the title but they were exactly what I was looking for! I bought these to wear with a costume, but like the look of them so much I've worn as an accessory with dresses. They are super flattering on my face and I'm tempted to see if I could get prescription lenses for them. Awesome. I like it These were much better than I expected! After I opened them, I was pleased to find out that they are actually very sturdy and not as likely to break as other cheap glasses. Then I put them on, and WOW! They were super comfortable! I'm using these to make my own version of ""Google Glass"" as my base, so I need to attach a bunch of stuff to them. I couldn't be happier because of the comfort and durability. Bought 3 pairs because I break glasses I’ve broken probably 4 pairs off these, they aren’t very well made at all. They are cute and cheap so I suppose for now I’ll keep buying new ones until I find a pair I like more.",1,1

"Love that I was able to find this shirt even though the DARE program has been gone for awhile now. It's nice to have something that reminds me of childhood and not in used condition. Great shirt. Reminds me of elementary school days. Not a bad 420 wear either. The sizes are mens I think. The XL was bigger than expected. Still cute tho. Made out of Froot of the Loom t-shirt. As a 90s kid this gave me a bit of nostalgia. I've received many compliments at bars and It fits me well. Husband loved it I’ve wanted one of these t-shirts for ages but a search years ago from the UK yielded no results. Now in Japan I could order from US amazon an official shirt :) Has a funky smell, but it’s a dare shirt just as it said it would be. they liked the shirt",1,1
"I’m so glad I bought this box of goodies!  It is a wonderful variety of snacks: sweet stuff and salty stuff, and many treats I had never even heard of before. I bought it for myself, but I will also be buying it for some family members too! Loved the chomps snack sticks (except the cranberry), not so much the mission.  Loved the nuts and chips - except the plain plantain, but think that’s just our taste buds.  Have y’all ever heard of the whole me brand?  Might be good to incorporate too.  Overall really enjoyed.  Would love more tips for son going thru elimination diet! I bought a care package for my daughter and she loved it!!!! Lots of healthy and lovely treats! My son loved it...great variety of snacks and much cheaper than wht is on campus. My daughter loved this care package and loved the variety of snacks. It was a gift & the recipients told me they just loved it. The family's on a Paleo diet so, when it came time to finding an appropriate item I just looked up Paleo on Amazons' drop down menu & Voila ! Thanks to your company I was able to find the perfect gift. Ramen cooker is perfect for dorm room. The cooked treats only require hot water or microwave, which is also perfect for dorm rooms. There is something for everyone in this care pack! sent to my mother as a get-well package.  I love that these snacks were mostly ready-to-eat",1,1
"These do run on the smaller size and seem to shrink after washing so I’d definitely recommend ordering a size up. My 2 year old grand daughter loved these.  Wanted to wear all 7 pairs in the same day.  We are potty training so big girl panties are a big deal - PJ Mask makes them that much better. My daughter loves these! There's a good variety of images for the PJ Masks. The color also seems to be holding up really well. We've washed them three or four times and they still have all the bright, vibrant color Still waiting for her to use the potty, but she really liked them! My daughter LOVES them lol I liked that they was PJ Masks, but they was way smaller and way low quality then what I expected. 3 pair ripped while trying to put them on my girl. They could go on with little force, but they was to tight around her cubby legs. They was such thin material that they ripped easily. Perfect fit. she loved them",1,1
"I've colored and flat-ironed by long hair for over 10 years, assuming it was necessary for my ""frizzy"" mane. After 4 uses, I blow-dry and go. I was skeptical after the first two washes - my hair seemed a little dry, but considering weather and the prior condition of my hair, I kept using the product and I'm really glad that I did. I do apply some argon oil after use, but as a heat protectant for the hair dryer and I've found that if you apply a small amount of conditioner to the ends of your hair, let it sit, then comb another small amount from root to tip, let it sit - it really makes ALL the difference. It sounds like a process to some, but just use that time to shave your legs, ladies! I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I've noticed that my hair is much more curly and manageable after a while of using it. I used to always have to put product in my hair because it gets frizzy and my curls just fall but now I just leave my hair as is and bam it doesn't look a mess! So I am very pleased with this product! his is one of my favorite brands and a product I buy over and over. I bought it for the kids and this time I tried a different scent. Its so clean, quality ingredients and smells amazing. The conditioner is really good for kid tangles-all of them.  Natures Gate is a go to brand always. The conditioner is okay but the shampoo made my hair even more dry and difficult to work with. From the moment I put it on my head, I could feel my hair getting stiff and tangled while I'm trying to rub it around evenly. Have not tried any of the other versions of this brand, ended up switching to a different brand all together. These bottles are big and don't need too much to wash all this hair I have. The conditioner is great!! Will order again. Thank you The worst products I have ever used for my hair. The worst part is I bought two sets this one and the aloe Vera one ...I ended up using the shampoo' s as hand soap in the bathroom.These products dry out you hair so bad it's impossible to comb they don't smell good and in my opinion just bad quality. I threw out the conditioner I should have returned this for a full refund but I kept hoping they would work. They don't!!!... I  threw out the conditioner couldn't think of anything I could reuse those for 😞 Would not purchase again. I had to wash my hair so much just to get rid of the sticky residue, and my hair would end up dry and coarse. Conditioner was OK, but ended up having to apply some oil to help with moisturizing. There are better vegan + cruelty free options out there. Disappointed because Nature's Gate usually makes decent products. I have used this brand for many for years after trying a few other cruelty free options.  It lathers and conditions like a dream and the Jojaba especially smells heavenly!  It is also reasonably priced for those on a budget.  I don't know about especially dry or oily hair, but I have normal, thick and fine hair which is color treated.  Both shampoo and conditioner are thick and creamy and  a little goes a long way so a bottle lasts a long time.",1,1
"UPDATE (11/11/16): The running shoes I bought the glue for a few months ago are nearly retired, and I never had to reapply the glue! Most of the runs in those shoes were even on gravel and other abrasive surfaces. Truly a professional product, and I oddly can't wait for another pair of shoes to need fixing because this makes them like new. Love the quick and durable fix this glue provides. I was very skeptical at first and thought it wouldn't be worth the trouble and the money, but I'm sure glad to be wrong! The sole of my daughter's fairly new Levi's work boots has come apart on one foot after she decided to play soccer in them :D She even put this glue on her Christmas list! So I ordered it and fixed her boot without putting it off. After cleaning the surface, applying the glue and pressing the boot together for just a minute, it stayed in place and there was no sign of previous damage. It looked perfectly new. I let the glue set for a day (just in case) and my daughter has been wearing them since - can't even tell they were glued! Amazing product. I could have saved so many shoes, had I known about it earlier! I have a $150 pair of Eccos where the sole started coming apart from the leather upper.  The shoes have about 1.5 years of use so I wasn't shocked.  The seam was almost unnoticeable by eye, but everytime I stepped down on that shoe they 'squished' and made a soft squishing sound.  I squirted a little of this glue in the joint and held it for 15 secs per the instructions.  No more seam,, no more squishing..  THis stuff is awesome but easy to get on your hands and furniture if you're not careful This is THE best glue I've ever bought in my life.  I've now fixed shoes, chairs, wood, etc.  Pretty much anything will stay together with this tough stuff.  I hike about 12 hours each weekend and the seams on my boots had torn apart in one spot.  Held it together with glue for 30 seconds and another 50 hours of hiking later, I'm a happy camper.  Excellent stuff!  This will replace any super glue/gorilla glue going forward for me! I bought this after the soles started coming off some relatively new Osiris shoes. This adhesive is basically a high-viscosity super glue, and it works very well on shoes; I imagine you could use the remainder on other broken items needing good super glue. Make sure things are clean before you start, follow the directions, and have a damp paper towel and some nail polish remover ready for the inevitable dribbles. Not so happy with the shoes, but this glue saved them from the bin. Bought this as a final attempt to save a favorite pair of shoes I've had since college & I can confidently say that this glue has added at least a few more wearable years :) Great stuff! Worth the money to me to get the right adhesive. I have used it to repair some sandals that are quite expensive and my favorites. I enjoy some pretty serious backpacking in the Rocky Mountain States and this adhesive will now be a part of my emergency repair kit. It has earned my confidence. Lasted a day. Bought to repair a loose sole on some merrells which why do these shoes in particular all have the same defect?? Anyways followed directions and even waited a full 36 hours before walking.  Came undone.",1,1

"These are absolutely delicious! They taste just like cheez-its. I bought these crackers for my 14-month-old grandson who became ill from milk and soy products. These are the closest thing to Cheezits that I could find, and he really loves them.  The smell of these are quite strong, but he doesn't care! My daughter is allergic to dairy and has always wished she could eat cheez-its.  These crackers have filled that void and she loves them.  I was surprised when I tried them and liked them too.  Not exactly like cheez-its, but very close.  Great job, once again, Earth Balance!  Thanks for looking out for those with food allergies. These don't taste like cheese to me.  They taste like a combination of wheat, salt, and nutritional yeast.  I suspect that I could make something that tastes similar in my kitchen.  They are not worth their high price unless you are A) rich B) desperately trying to stay vegan in the face of a Cheez-It craving.  I'm willing to pay a premium for something vegan that actually tastes like cheese, but not these salty wheat squares. I was really excited about these and I am so glad that they are even being produced. I would never be able to find something like these crackers where I live. I buy Earth Balance spreads when I can afford/find them and really enjoy them.  I try never to waste food, especially specialty foods like this, but I could not finish the box as there was a strange, almost foot-like aftertaste. I will still continue to support this company though, and try all of the products that I can. These do not taste like ""its or even nips"", but... I actually enjoyed them. They have their own taste and I noticed it's what I kept going for on our road trip. Dare I say, I actually started craving the taste. I've reordered and found them at a local store. a great vegan snack. I really wanted to love these, but they have a very strange smell and a weird after taste. My husband wouldn't let me eat them near him because he said they smelled like dirty feet. They tasted a bit better, but you must brush your teeth after eating. I really hope they change the recipe and try again as I would love to try them again. My son has a pretty sever dairy and egg allergy.  I am always looking for some good snacks for him that are portable and don't make him feel left out.  These do the trick.  He has had NO reaction to them whatsoever.  Which means they are COMPLETELY compliant for a dairy/egg allergy.  I also tasted these and they taste very good.  Surprisingly good and surprisingly cheesy!  It's a great, healthy snack for anyone on a vegan diet!",1,1
Purchase these for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves them. Also got her the matching bra. So happy she's wanting to  Replace all her underwear even Victoria secret stuff for these. inlove with my panty wuooo😍😍😍💘 I like the fact fabric and fit.,1,1
"The vest looks a little richer in the photo and could stand to have a more tailored cut and just an FYI the tie comes pre tied with a hook like a ""clipon"", but overall I was very happy with the item and it arrived long before the promised date without extra shipping It was a little bit big on me, but that was to be expected since I'm female. The tie in the back helped a lot, though. It's really comfortable, and the outside is silky and pleasant to touch. I'm not usually one to wear patterns together, but the matching tie actually looked really nice. Was alittle tight but good quality Grooms vest. Looked fantastic!",1,1
"Wearing it. As a signet ring as a finger spinner I like it does not snag does not get in the way as a ring it's actually pretty light. The only problem it has Is after initial running it in water the internal Mandala comes off a little bit I don't mind this since I know it but others my be style sensitive. I’m sure it’s fine if you get the right size. I ordered a size ten. Everything on the bag said size 10. But it was hopelessly too small—probably around a size 7 or 6. I don’t know if the product just runs small or mine was mislabeled. Either way, I’m sending it back. Very pretty ring need bigger size but now i will have one for each finger Pretty good looks ok Nice design; very intricate details but the sizes avalible at time of purchase were inconvenient. For a size 10 1/2 finger, ten is too small and eleven is too big. Keeping the size 11 ring though. Good looking ring...and it is a spinner!! Nice quality items prompt respond love AlexTina was one of my favorite Excellent customer service love the rings 👌👍👏",1,1

"My stylist recommended this shampoo to me when she colored my hair. Because of the cost I was reluctant. She isn’t the type to push a product just so she can make money off of it, so I knew she must really like it. After some consideration I decided to bite the bullet, and order it just to see. I must say, I LOVE this shampoo. I have noticed such a difference in my hair’s softness, as well as the longevity of the vibrancy of my hair color. The old adage of “You get what you pay for” really is true in this case. It’s a bit pricey, sure, but it’s well worth it. I have also noticed it doesn’t take much to get a good lather, so a little goes a long way. For color treated hair, I cannot recommend this shampoo enough. THIS IS FAKE! When you read the label and compare it to the real bottle, the differences are insane!!! BEWARE of sellers!! I use only salon products. I remember when Pureology came on the market around 2009. My hairdresser began selling it and used it on clients. I have color treated, naturally curly hair and I've always searched for the products that help me tame the curls and frizz. I remember how my hair color used to fade between treatments. Purelogy's claim to fame was that color was guaranteed to last longer and hair would be conditioned like no other product. They also bragged that the cost is relative because they put less water in the product and therefore you use less. I usually purchase this item through my hairdresser but had to purchase through this dealer. It was awful. Either it was a botched item or different formula all together. It was not the quality that I used before. I will never buy again at this site. Waste of money. Wish I could have returned it and got refund. Threw it out after trying it a few times, shook it up no difference. This is the only shampoo I use. It suds up nicely. Does not dry my hair out or strip the color. It seems to help retain the proper tone in you color with its purple color. Nice to not have to go out and waste my time at the beauty supply store. I've tried a lot of products to thicken my hair and make it softer. Nixon, viviscal, etc. The price made me cry but I've been using the pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks. My hair is noticeably softer. Right after my shower I don't even have to add product. The color fanatic spray from pureology is amazing too. My hair is so freaking soft! Absolutely do not like the smell. The bottle are very small and due to their small size and the thickness of the bottle it is difficult to get the shampoo out. It does clean your hair but the smell is a put off for me. I love the smell and it's a great shampoo for living in a humid area.  I have wavy hair and a ton of it.  It helps keep the frizzies down to a mild roar.  Also, a little bit goes a LONG way as it is super concentrated.  Kind of makes up for how expensive it is.",1,1
"I really like this hat. It looks pretty sporty. The large brim is of uniform length all around the crown of the hat, offering more coverage than a conventional boonie hat. From the looks of it, this hat can withstand being folded and crushed without breaking. Try that with a straw hat.  The two mesh vents on each side of the hat provides ventilation, keeping your head cool. Again, this is a vast improvement over straw hats, which often traps in heat, and I'm sure many gardeners, lifeguards, and fishermen are familiar with that heating effect when working outside under a hot, blazing sun. It's also much lighter in weight than a straw hat.  It travels well in a suitcase; just fold it, and wrap the neck strap around it a couple of times, and you're good to go. Has the UV protection and is a very wide brimmed hat. Love the chin strap for wind, which can be tucked in the hat if it's not windy and you don't want it to show. The brim is not ""floppy"" it's harder and sturdy, which I like. My last sun hat got so misshapen after washing it just flopped around my This is a really nice hat, comfortable, fashionable, and good sun protection. However, it IS NOT waterproof. I took it on a cruise to rainy Alaska, and at our first port I sadly discovered that the hat leaked. Water did seem to roll off of the brim, but the actual part around my head soaked through immediately. I had to buy a new hat for the remainder of the trip. Fortunately, the new hat was waterproof! That said, if you want a great hat for hiking, gardening, beach, etc., this would be perfect. I let the company know my dissatisfaction, and they refunded my money and were really wonderful about it. So, five stars for the company, and the hat gets five stars for sun protection, zero for rain. So, I split the difference and gave it a three. Rating is based on initial use. Bought this hat for my trip to Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon. The hat I received had a defective chin strap - it didn't lock into place - but I still brought it along because I didn't have time to buy another hat. It was perfect for our summer hike! The brim was wide enough to shield my face and nape from the sun; at the same time, the material was breathable. When I got back from my trip, I contacted the seller regarding the chin strap issue. They were very friendly and responsive. They sent me a 99% discount code for the item so that I could purchase it again. I know it's not ENTIRELY free, but really... what is 13 cents these days? :o) I wanted a rain hat so what I don't like about it is the vents in the sides.  In the Northwest the rain goes right through that. If you want it as a sun hat the vents will probably keep you cooler.  It is an okay hat, i just can't use it for Oregon rain. Use it kayaking for the first time today and love the hat. Water rolled right off it, kept the sun off my face but allowed me to see everything around me. Kept my head cool too. Not sure how anyone could complain about size since you can lock it into any possible size you would need.  I have a small head and its hard for me to find a hat that fits but this one is perfect since I can adjust it down to my size. Excellent value.  Wide brim provides plenty of shade all around. Good ventilation.  Lightweight. Foldable yet holds its shape. Comparable to hats retailing for $50. This hat helps me protect from the UVA Rays so I won't get sunburn on my face. So I recommend this product for covering sun block for face and back of the neck.",1,1
"I love these makeup remover cloths so much! I've really gotten into Asian skincare over the last several months, so I'm using an oil cleanser before my regular cleanser at night. The oil cleanser is meant to dissolve makeup, sunscreen, etc., but on my heavier makeup days these cloths are my first step in my nightly skincare routine because they get the makeup wiped off perfectly so my other products can do their jobs. OBSESSED with these. I'm a skin freak - and HATE using make up wipes since they make my face feel oily and gross. I run these under hot water, rub and my makeup is off completely. I honestly don't understand how or why it happens but it's magic! I recommend it to all my friends and family. LOVE that I just can wash them with my laundry and it's like brand new and still works. This product... I have no clue how this works, but it does! Let me start by saying I was wearing a full face of make up. I mean foundation, contour highlight, eyeliner, seriously the whole nine yards. All I did was wet it and wiped my face, my jaw literally dropped. This is hands down my favorite make up remover at the moment. The best part is that they are reusable so you don't have to keep buying those expensive disposables that leave your face feeling greasy. At first I was pretty impressed -- these really do a great job of getting rid of makeup, just get them damp and wipe your face. You don't even need soap! HOWEVER... After giving it some thought, I realized I have a large bag of about 50 microfiber towels from Costco (Kirkland brand), and I wondered if there was any difference between the inexpensive, larger, bulk-bag of towels from Costco and this dinky little three-pack of microfiber ""make-up remover cloths."" So I decided to compare the two, and lo and behold, the inexpensive jumbo pack towels from Costco work JUST AS WELL, IF NOT BETTER for removing makeup, and are just as gentle on the skin and effective at exfoliating. So my advice is to find some inexpensive microfiber towels (Costco if you have a membership), and forego these. Sure, these work, but they are not any better than other microfiber towels. LOVE this product!!!Great value!!I put all kind of my makeup products on my arm and just clean them with warm WATER and it really did a great job! The foundation is the easiest one to clean(you can see it's cleansing ability in the pictures)This amazing stuff is very useable for me cause i don't wear a lots of makeup, and it clean my foundation very quickly which saves my times and money!But if you do wear a lots of makeups,maybe it won't work as well as mine.All in all, i am so happy that i made a good deal!Would definitely buy it again! I was skeptical of these, but now I'm pretty sure they're what Mulan's outfit was made of when she wiped her makeup off on her sleeve in the movie.  Even totally dry they're pretty impressive about taking all of my makeup (including waterproof eyeliner and mascara) in a couple swipes.  I like to use a little micellar water to make my skin feel a little cleaner.  It's nice not to burn through so many cotton pads.  Amazed how well these work! No need for face wash, but doesn't hurt if you prefer. Takes off even stubborn stain lipstick and waterproof mascara! These are great travel size towels and, yes their quality can’t match that of the more expensive make-up remover towels, but for the price, they’re a great buy! They do work and for everyday use, they aren’t going to last very long, but for occasional use, they do a great job removing your make-up and are actually a great make-up removing microfiber towel that will last you for everyday use for about a month or more and for such a great price for 3 of them, it’s actually reasonable. If you aren’t a person who wears make-up very often, or if you only wear eye make-up, you might actually get quite a bit of use out of these. Another alternative for these is to use them as hot towels to steam your face before doing at home facial treatments or serum applications. I have ordered a few packs of these as add-on items and like having them on hand for when my other make-up towels are in the wash or just when I need a quick facial cloth. A clean microfiber towel on hand is always great to have handy to keep around to keep acne at bay and your skin looking its best!",1,1
"I bought it as an alternative to Mother Earth organic coffee. I bought a light roast and totally disappointed in the quality. It has no flavor, at all. it is as bland and possible, in cappuccino you cannot even taste coffee. It is a HUGE contrast with another organics coffees I bought and it ks not in a good way. The bag came full of air and vent was nor seal well. Beans looked overly dry and dull color-wise. I got the light roast.  It had almost no coffee flavor.  I tried several different brewing methods and doubled the amount of beans I usually use.  Still weak.  The coffee had very little aroma when I opened the bag.  I usually get light roast because I don't like the burnt flavor some coffees have (Starbucks).  The beans were much harder to grind than any other coffee I have. (Obviously,  I use a manual grinder.)  I also tried the Don Pablo Decaf Swiss Water Process Colombian Gourmet Coffee Decaffeinated - Medium-Dark Roast.  It is one of the better decaf coffees I've tried.  Clean  bold flavor. I don't know how other people are brewing this coffee but I've been using my Saeco automatic espresso machine and the coffee produced is some of the best I've ever had. Even though it's not ""espresso"" designated coffee it comes out with a nice crema and holds up well with milk if that is your preference. I have my machine set to deliver an 8 oz. cup. Using this method I get a very nice cup with a strong but smooth coffee taste. And do you know that light roasted coffee is the most health beneficial, containing more antioxidants and the highest caffeine per volume measure? This is my new ""go to"" coffee. as espresso this was disappointing.  I haven't tried drip-brew.  In my typical espresso procedure the crema is thin and even the shot volume is low - I tend to cycle it twice just to get higher volume (I am not fussy about taste and I expect this makes it more bitter).  Flavor is ""bright"", fruity, a little bitter.  Even as cappuccino it's a little sour. I only drink USDA Organic coffee, and based on the number of 5 Star reviews, I was eager to try these light roast beans. When percolating these beans by themselves (whether drinking it black with organic Stevia, or with organic vanilla soy milk and Stevia), I find the chocolaty/cocoa signature profiles are far too dominating for my palate... the overpowering of chocolate/cocoa is the only reason why I'm deducing 2 stars. We try to eat/drink as healthy as possible even down to the creamer in our coffee.  Was skeptical when I first ordered this coffee as I buy whole bean organic coffee at my grocery store and wondered if this would be really any different. We grind and brew our coffee.  At first I tried the Medium-Dark Roast but found it a little too bitter to my liking even with making adjustments to our brewing process. Then I saw the Light Roast and decided to give it a try.  It is the PERFECT all-around coffee.  Smooth and delicious.  We are on our third or fourth 2 lb bag, and I love that it is not only organic, but also fair-trade associated.  It is the perfect complement to our ""healthy"" creamer which we buy online at Amazon as well, nutpods Dairy-free Coffee Creamer, 12-pack (Unsweetened French Vanilla).  I only wish this coffee could be found under ""Subscribe and Save"" as well!!!! C'mon Amazon! It is delicious!!!! (3rd time ordering the 2lb bags) I add 5 scoops for a full carafe just and it comes out perfect!!!! Extremely happy with this coffee. Brewed with my Ninja coffee bar (freshly cleaned) Really did come out amazing! Not bitter at all, full flavor. I tried the lighter roast but this is my favorite. Funny even my wife can tell the difference (she would make her coffee from a big plastic container of Maxwell House swill) she wont drink that stuff anymore she will only drink the Don Pablo now!! It truly is a High Quality Coffee at an affordable price. Going to be getting the 5lb bags as I seem to be drinking much more coffee since I found this stuff!!! LOL! Thank you to Don Pablo for keeping this at a good fair price!! So glad I found an excellent , wonderful tasting Organic coffee. on line. Was tired of buying expensive over rated loose beans in so called freshly roasted, expensive stores, i.e Kings, Whole Foods etc. I buy  the Cafe Don Pablo  in both the dark and the medium blend and have enjoyed the  full  flavor and aroma in every cup. I store the excess beans in a glass or stainless steel container and it stays fresh. The coffee comes well packed in well made bags, and delivery is prompt.  This coffee is reasonably priced and have been ordering for about 4 mos and intend to continue.",1,1

"The good: The length of the sides that go to the ears is too short.  The ends are just at my ears making the glasses tilt down just a bit.  If they had used straight ends it wouldn't be an issue.  These are made for individuals with small heads.  The size of the ""glass"" part is fine and it does help with eye strain.  I would recommend looking for a pair with either longer sides or sides that go straight all the way back. These glasses are as amazing as they sound.  Don't get cheap imitation ones with yellow lenses that are going to screw up your perception of color.  These are the real-deal, high-quality, genuine article...  they are even scratch-resistant, for us OCD types that are constantly cleaning our glasses.  Even the case they come in is awesome.  The hipster ones look cooler, but I have to say I like these Wayfarers better for daily use (bigger lenses = better field of view).  I bought one of each.  I wear them whenever I have screen time, which is damn near all day long.  My eyes have never felt better, I rarely get headaches anymore, and I sleep like a baby.  No more having my skull violated by blue LED or florescent lighting... no more closing my eyes at the end of the day and seeing strobe lights behind my lids.  These are a tinfoil hat for a real modern problem.  Customer for life, here. These are amazing. As an accountant I'm staring at a computer for close to 10 hours a day. I used to get headaches pretty regularly from the screen time, especially during tax season. Now don't get me wrong; they're not a cure-all for any headache you get from looking at a computer, and there are still days where I leave work with an obnoxious screen ache. But for the most part, they make a big difference. I was blown away a couple weeks after purchasing them: I wasn't using them at the time, and I noticed my eyes starting to get that fatigue feel, knowing a screen ache was coming on. So I threw on the glasses, and it was literally a night and day difference! I didn't realize how effective these glasses are until that day. They're great lenses. The amber tint is only  discernible at an extremely close distance while worn. Once on, you will notice the tint filter on displays, but for the most part your eyes adjust enough to distinguish tones of colours just as if you didn't have the glasses on. Five star quality - arrived in perfect condition and well-packaged by Spektrum.  Very pleased with the minimal impact these glasses have on colors, as that was the main reason I wanted to try them, and the price was reasonable to warrant this personal experiment. I haven't gotten a headache since getting these but they are a little hard to clean. very good quality. only issue that we had is that the clear isnt completely clear. granted these are far more clear than my full yellows for blue light blockingbut if youre going to be photo editing and wanted to change hues and color warmth, i recommend taking the glasses off since the slight yellowing does change the color a slight amount",1,1

"This vest and tie set met my expectation. My husband loved it and so did I. Fits perfectly... great feel.... can't complain one bit... Nice Good quality, good fit. Nice looking vests.  Shipping too much when you order multiple quantities. I've purchased quite a few of these and have probably paid about $100 in shipping alone. Make sure the buttons are completely attached though. Perfect accessory for Santa outfit. Sizing instructions are incorrect resulting in an incorrect selection. Will now have to pay for a professional alteration to make suitable.",1,1
"Buttons do not fit in the holes . Waste of money.  Very disappointed. It looks just like its pictured great quality, I can't wait till my little ones born so he can use it!! I bought 2 the blue and the off white.  The colors in the picture are true to the actual item for these two.  They are cable knit like a scarf that fold up on itself.  There is no way to button it because the buttons are at least 3 times bigger than the button holes.  The button holes cannot be made bigger because the knitting would unravel if clipped.  I ended up replacing the buttons to fit the holes.  The description says, ""Material inside: knit ; Material outside: Polar Fleece"".  There is no polar fleece anywhere; it is just knit. And I don't know if it says in the description, but be aware they are Made in China. Really cute. Love it. Super soft and true to color! The red it's so pretty. This is a catch 22. Cute product, but had a weird smell. The buttons came shipped unbuttoned and it took a lot of work to get them fixed like in the pic, but certainly not impossible. I'd purchase again for another baby gift. This is a nice product but should have more sizes, it says 0-12 months. But good till 3 months, my baby is 3 month old and this is completely fitted, was hoping to use it longer Absolutely love it, it is very well made the fabric is nice and soft, the button holes are small enough that they won't stretch out of shape and not keep it buttoned.  We absolutely love it",1,1

"My son loved it and got soo many complements about it!! There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this amazing belt...PERIOD!!  Literally for $10 this belt is 100% PERFECT in every way possible.  Sizing was dead on, width was thick enough so it wasn't in question as if its a mens or womans belt but not crazy thick to where its hard to loop thru the jeans, the buckle was also dead on in size and wasn't super tiny like a lot of other belts that are attempting to portray a certain very expensive designer belt.  I highly recommend this belt to anyone who is in need of a suttle leather belt with a very nice and modest buckle.  Doesn't look like you were out of pocket trying to front like you can afford some crazy designer belt from Italy or something.  I wouldn't  be suprised if this belt had better materials anyway so go for it you wont be upset.  I got the silver/black one & received it in a very stricktly packaged manner ensuring the integrity and well being of the belt.  Also came with a blue dust bag.  10-10 Perfect. Very nice one Really nice belt. Fits perfectly Very nice belt ! It’s ok just as described. ok",1,1
"Metal squeaks as you walk... -100 points. good product The clothes are very good, I like it very much, the size is just good, the color is good. Its an ok belt...the buckle is somewhat noisy which makes it seem a bit cheap but the belt does what its supposed to do. i love it. love it. Thought it would be a bit more luxe but it wasn't. Very nice and fit me well",1,1

"These folding readers are identical in form and function to the overpriced branded versions, found in local retail outlets. I purchased these and three pair of  Southern Seas Mens Womens Folding Reading & Travel glasses at the same time. Love the foldable compact reading glasses! They fit in the small cases and are great! I carry them every where and they are stylish to boot! They hide in my pocket so when I go out to lunch or to the theater, I can easily pull the out to read the menus or play billet. My neighbor liked them so much, I ordered her two! Perfect for my needs. Sturdy and dependable. And clear vision in the strength I needed! I bought several pair to be able to leave them at key spots so I don't have to remember to move the around and the cases keep the safe and sound! These are compact and quick to unfold, and easily fit in my pants pocket.  They are great reading glasses.  Regular reading glasses always fall out of my shirt pocket, which is why I especially like these foldable ones. These are not branded like some of the others, but they are basically the same thing as the more expensive items. Quality isn't always perfect, but I've also seen that with the brand names too. The reason I went with these was price and I know that I'm going to be rough on them and that they will eventually break. If you have expectations that these - or any others that use the same mechanism to fold - will last a long time, then you will be disappointed... unless of course if you only use them periodically. I tend to fidget with the lids on the cases while they are in my pocket, so that's usually the first to go. I carry them everywhere everyday, which puts a lot of wear and tear on them. Again, these hold up just as well as name brands I've used. For some reason I did not know these folded up and came in a nice hard-case. The ear stems are like radio antennas, you pull them out to use them and retract them when you want to fold them up  and put them into the case. Well, they're replacing reading glasses I brought from Amazon for ONE PAIR for $25. Nice and stylish but not folding king kind, large and bulky with case and then small screw holding arm started working it's way out and before I had a chance ti fix, dropped off completely. Now I have &25 glasses just sitting until I can get them fixed, if I do at all. I really like these glasses. I was using another brand that I will not mention here and I was happy with them. I saw these and decided to give them a try. These glasses are better for different reasons, 1: The carrying case protects the glasses and fit easily in my pocket; 2: glasses are made with strong material; 3: I really like the telescoping ear pieces; and 4: overall better quality.",1,1

"Great support plus adds some bulge definitely recommend these. Good quality, great texture, resilient fabric, and versitile design. Perfect fit and they really do exactly what they detail in the description. Although it works a bit, it's too tight and small has no room for your own parts. And could look more realistic. But for most part, it works and adds some to the area. Not what I expected for the price, was  disappointed. Plus the Item was delayed arriving, did not arrive when it was suppose to. for those who want more of a basket these are perefect. Fit perfectly.So soft and sexy.Really enhances like they say!Perfect!I will be buying more of these beauties! Perfect",1,1

"I gotta say I’m quite impressed with overall quality of this product. Previously, I did some extensive research on baby monitor for my first daughter and this one is for the second. I had a bad luck with previous baby monitor that I had, so I was skeptical with this one as well. I have just received it and yet to try the full potentials. Following are pros and cons thus far: We bought this monitor and was very excited about being able to use this when I'm away to look in on the kids.  However, the camera will not connect to wifi.  I am pretty handy with technology and have been unsuccessful.  I contacted customer service and explained the issue.  They said it was most likely the camera so we returned it and ordered another one and there is still problems.  From my experience, I don't believe it is a camera issue but rather an application problem.  It will connect on setup but drop the connection as soon as you leave the setup screen.  So far this is the only flaw with this camera but it is a big one for me.  Other than this issue, I love the camera.  It has great video, range, and is easy to use. I bought this monitor in July. I have really liked it, the camera and the sensor. Today, one month and a half after, it started failing. The camera seems to blink and the image is very dark and poor. I have not requested a return or an exchange yet. I expected a lot more of the app and the watch. The app is so simple! Being Samsung I thought it would be better. Here's a picture of the current image. This monitor has some nice features, but it is far from great. We decided to purchase this monitor because of the wifi capability of it. That feature is unusable due to the app not working. It constantly disconnects from the monitor all the time. Basically doesn't work at all. the features on the screen of the parent unit are nicer than many monitors we have used. I like that it is touch screen too. Also, the signal range for the parent unit is no where near accurate. I can be in the next room over from the camera and the signal will not reach. Overall, This monitor has a few nice features but I am definitely not super happy with it! DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT A WIFI MONITOR. Really like this monitor so far. Picture quality is very clear in daylight, haven't used it much at night yet for an accurate review. The app works well and we get service throughout our 3 story 2000 sq ft home. Love that it pan & tilts. I had a hard time finding any monitors that do that. Love the sensor but the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the sensor is not built in so I can't mount this on the wall like I wanted. The watch is a nice extra however I'm not sure I'll really use it. This monitor is working out really well. The tablet is a nice size, though it can be a bit slow to respond to taps. The camera is clear, and the sound pick up is great - the 2 way communications from tablet to camera is great too, for if my wife needs something while in the babys room or I need to let her know about something from outside (Or vice versa of course!)",1,1

"This is my most favorite coffee of all time! Any coffee lover would enjoy this coffee as it's not weak and doesn't lack flavor.  I think it's one of the boldest and best tasting coffee I've ever had and considering how strong it is, you'd be surprised to not taste any bitterness.  It has a very smooth, bold flavor with a hint of chicory with a slight sweetness.  I drink my coffee with cream and sugar but I can imagine how nice it would be for someone who takes it straight.  It does have some oomph in it so expect to get a jolt of caffeine.  It's great as the first cup and as an afternoon pickerupper.  It's stronger than any supermarket shelf brand (Folgers, Maxwell House, etc) and stronger than Sumatra, Verona, Revv and most ""dark"" types but very very smooth.  Try it once and I bet you'll buy it again. I like the coffee but one of the 24-count boxes only had 23 pods in it. You’d think they would be able to count to 24. Not sure I’ll buy their product again. There are other dark roast k-cups from other companies. Why did I ever stop buying this??? Well, I'm back and the taste is strong and great and I won't make that mistake again.  I add milk and stevia sweetener to my coffee, but the taste is smooth, not bitter. I love this coffee! I've tried a number of different kinds since I obtained my Keurig and this is easily my favourite. It's a nice dark roast with a strong but smooth flavour and perfect to kick start your day if you like a flavoursome brew. If you enjoy a rich, bold cup of coffee then Black Tiger is the coffee for you.  It provides an invigorating aroma and a strong cup of coffee to start your day. This has been one of my favorite coffees to date. Not a happy camper in the A M, but this helps get me in at least a civil mood & moving. My family is grateful too. Decent bold taste, but not as much kick as I'd hoped for.  Have found another now that's at least as good for nearly half the cost. Excellent Buy and Excellent Coffee although Coffee People have discontinued this coffee",1,1
"I’m not sure what to make of this little “INSTAX Mini” camera.  As someone who is very familiar with the original Polaroid cameras back in the ‘50’s and ‘60’s, I was curious as to what this Fuji version had to offer.  The value of an instant camera is that you can take pictures and see them (or give them away) instantly.  Back when the Polaroid was all the rage, this was a big deal since ordinary film needed to be sent out for processing, meaning you wouldn’t see your photos (much less be able to share them with friends and family) for a week or more.  These days, however, digital photos are the norm – and you can give a digital photo instantly (and free of charge) via text or email.  Of course, that requires everyone to have access to a phone or computer. Love it!!!!! I had a polaroid as kid. This is like reliving my childhood . Back in the good ol Polaroid day!!!! My daughter was excited to get this for Christmas. But we were all disappointed when it came without batteries. And they aren’t normal batteries so she had to wait before she could use it. Not to mention that the batteries cost upwards of $20. Batteries were supposed to be included so I’d just say if it’s a gift open it and make sure they are in there first. I would have requested a replacement but I can’t hardly do that on Christmas morning. Fun little thing. Bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter. I believe she's elated with it. On and off she's been asking for an Instax camera for a few years now. This has been around for a long time so it's more or less ""tested and proven"". Will simply do what it says on the box. Main concern is always going to be the cost of the film. At almost a buck a shot it can get scary real fast. For me there's also the possibility the novelty will wear off for her after several months. Not sure which I'd prefer. This was a huge Christmas commodity in our area this past year. I worried that we would spend a decent amount of money on something that our daughter would get bored with after a couple weeks, but she is still obsessed with it. Many of her friends parents have asked me where I got our daughters and so far it has still been a hit. I chose this one for my daughter rather than the cheapest one because it has the selfie mirror on the front and because it has the hybrid of automatic/manual light settings. It works well and is worth the money for entertainment more so than photo quality. When we go on international mission trips and meet new people, it's fun to be able to leave a printed picture with them since they don't have phones. Fun camera, especially for kids.  In a generation with only digital photos, my children were delighted to be able to hold a photo of themselves instantly.  The photos are not as clear as a digital print, but that is to be expected since this is not a high resolution camera. I researched a lot of instant cameras, and this one had everything I was looking for. The pictures come out instantly and within 15 seconds you can see the picture develop before your eyes. The picture quality is excellent, they are crystal clear and have good color quality. I looked into Polaroid cameras, but found that even though the pictures are indeed bigger, they don't have the clarity this one does, the pictures take over 10 MINUTES to develop (not seconds), and the pictures still have that orange hew the old instant Polaroids use to have. Looking through the viewfinder is fantastic, its spot on and every picture I took got everything I wanted in the picture. Its simple and easy. The secondary button on the bottom of the camera is a little tricky. There is a possibility you can push it by accident and waste a much wanted film. This camera isn't bulky, its not too heavy, and the curvy design feels comfortable in the hands. Stock up on film, because with this camera you'll definitely want to take picture after picture. Addicted to photography WILL happen with this camera.",1,1
"Bought it with the intention to turn it into an OSMC client. $80 mini computer to play Full HD media, what more can you ask for? Good and fast delivery. i ordered and 2 days later it arrived. works and very happy with purchase. However, price is about 15 dollars more than other stores and some even came with heatsinks or ""official power adapters"". But overall good and reliable purchase as it is in original element 14 packaging for the pi 3b and the delivery is really fast, plus the one year warranty provided by them i guess? My only complaint is that the package is just wrapped in bubble wrap which caused the box to be slightly squashed. Bought it for my son to try out programming and he loved it. Bought a few more since. Nice Well packed and fast delivery. I will recommend this. Thanks.",1,1
"Fits perfectly. A little thin for just normal use. nipples are visible right through it. Looks good on my girlfriend though! These fit ever so slightly tighter than I expected. The neck has held its shape through several washings and I'm happy with these shirts. I tried some of the Amazon Essentials which were significantly cheaper but the neckline became misshapen after one washing. This was one of the first that popped up in my search white T-shirts and had a way better price than anything I could find in stores.  I went to Kohl's looking for something similar and they wanted to charge about 10$ per shirt!  I thought that was so ludicrous.  Anyway, these fit me perfectly.  I am average build, wider in the shoulders than I am in the waist - most of the time ;) - and after several wears, the color has remained very white.  I'm expecting them to hold up for a long time. These are great shirts.  I really like that they are slightly heavier weight than most t-shirts.  That lets them stand up to multiple washings with bleach and it lets the shirt drape in a way that appeals to me for a winter t-shirt.  This is a fine well-made product in this size. I have ordered it twice. Holy mackerel are these cheap. And terrible. For me, the first consideration is how the collar wears: it’s the only part that anyone can see. After a single wash (and before I wore it once), the collar looks slightly worn, like a T-shirt that I’ve had for a year. The fabric is thin - not breathes well, cozy thin, but cheap and won’t last long thin. And the fabric isn’t that soft. It’s already a little rough. I could hope that after a few washings it would soften up, but honestly, I don’t think this shirt will last that long. Hanes clearly tries to squeeze as much profit out of this shirt - and to be fair it’s a super cheap shirt - but this is unacceptable. As described. True to USA sizing (Amazon size chart), don’t wash in hot water and don’t dry in the dryer if you do t want the shirt to shrink since its cotton. Not too thin or thick. They come to the top of my thigh in a size medium, 39” bust. I’m 5’2 (female) I bought these for my son as a Christmas gift.  Such a great deal I bought 2 packs. They fit and launder well. Horrible product. I washed them before wearing and not only did they shrink and become misshapen, but one t shirt has holes already. Seems like a knockoff of the actual quality product.",1,1
"This headset are made well and satisfied with my purchase. I had bought my daughter a headset prior to these and they fit her head big, but these fit just like they are supposed  to. The purple and black color was a plus for her along with producing great sound. This is actually easy to use...adjustable ..does not fall on your face..great bass. very convenient volume control..i love it.. Very clear, they fit perfectly and the person on the other side can hear me very clear. I recommend for ps4 because these do not have the usb they have the aux end. I bought this for my daughter and she said it works great and she loves it. Very affordable! This game headset works well and like it very much. The sound is clear and noise cancelling. It looks very cool! And it works very well! I have big ears and this covers them entirely so my ears are being pressed on by the cushion, which was a problem with previous headsets. but this game headset fits, I like it. Comfortable design, better sound quality than expected for the price, booming base. recommend it. Good gaming headset. Easy to set up. Soft earmuffs ,stereo surround sound makes me enjoy gaming fun. Noise Cancelling functions well. I like this game headphone. Excellent customer service and great package.",1,1

Can be worn by either masculine or feminine people. Fabulous flat for a non catch or pull. Love them I got this for my stepson and he loves them Fast shipping . Great quality for the price Niice Good items for the price",1,1
"Ever since Aerosoles got rid of the Ivory Tree shoe I have been on the search for a replacement.  Many of their shoes have toe boxes that are simply too tight and let's face it, I'm delicate! This had to be the 12th pair that I tried.  I knew they were perfect when I put them on.  The memory foam foot bed makes up for the rather lackluster arch support.  The big things it they don't cause me any pain. I highly recommend these for other delicate souls.  Firstly, this review comes from someone with narrow feet. The shoes fit well for me. I am an 8.5-9 and got an 8.5. I like wearing my flats with no show socks and wore socks with these. They are just a tad snug but should stretch. Without socks they were a teeny tiny bit loose. The toebox is narrow so if you have bunions or a wide front I would not recommend it. The shoes do flare out a but when I bend them but this is pretty much the norm if you have narrow feet so I've learnt to live with it. Cushioning is great, upper is really soft leather. Can't comment on arch support because I've never had problems with that. The snake pattern is more of a suede leather so I sprayed some leather protector spray...fingers crossed any dirt will be easy to clean! Wish they had more patterns/colors. Would definitely consider stocking up on another pair. I wear a 10.5 wide - normally, I just get an 11 wide because most brands don't have a 10.5.  I did order the 11 wide in this shoe, and would not have wanted it any shorter.  Length wise, add half a size to your true size, or you might regret it.  I am returning this shoe because it is NOT wide. It says wide on the box - but it's just not. It's more of a medium. And it cuts into the top of my foot. I first bought this in black and received so many compliments I decided to get a second color. I love how comfortable these shoes are and the thickness of the soles. Traditional flats hurt my feet when I walk around a lot because they have such thin soles so I end up wearing tennis shoes a lot. But that is not the case here. Great professional comfy shoe. I only wish they had half sizes after size 10. I'm an 11.5 but the 12 fits ok with thicker socks. Very comfortable shoe. I usually wear a 10 and ordered the 10 1/2 size. I was not disappointed. The shoes are somewhat narrow in the toe area, so I recommended any one who purchases these shoes to order a 1/2 size larger in wide. The shoe is well made and has somewhat of a shine to it. It's very pretty. My only concern is that the shoe's material is similar to microseude fabric and will get dirty easily.  This is my first time buying shoes online and I was not disappointed.  I will be buying more Aerosoles  online. This is an uneven review -- I like the shoes a lot, the pattern is cute and I love the multi colors involved so I can wear them with black and most any color top, and it will look great.  I ordered the wide and really glad I did because the right shoe fits perfectly but the left is a little tight.  I've seen other reviews stating the same, which is really odd.  I want to keep these, I am going to give them thought for a few days.  They are comfortable, not much of any arch but they feel good.  They will look great with dress clothes or jeans, very versatile. This shoe is wonderfully comfortable. Buy the size that Amazon suggests for you personally. They suggested a half-number up for me, and it was spot on. I hate tight fitting shoes, but, of course, they shouldn't flop off my feet. These shoes fit perfectly. I have a long, slender foot. These shoes offer good support to a normal foot. They are soft and very easy to wear all day long. Last night, I had to stand on a half-frozen sidewalk without having a chance to move around for fear of losing my spot in the line at a taxi-rank, and I suddenly realized that my feet did not feel the cold at all. When I got home, I felt my feet and they were warm unlike other parts of me that'd been exposed to the icy breeze. So the soles of the shoe, and maybe the inner soles too, are well insulated against whatever is underneath your foot. I got these shoes in July already, so I've also been wearing them right through summer, and they never made my feet feel hot at all. This is a good product! I used to buy Aerosoles quite often years ago, all loafer styles, so I wasn't worried about buying these. Even buying on the larger side (I wear a 9 or 9.5 and purchased the 9.5), they were too tight across the top. I took them to be stretched (another 11.00 on top of the shoe price) and they are still not comfortable enough for me to wear. I might wear them at home to see if I can stretch them further, but I have my doubts. I'm afraid I just wasted what has now become 70-plus dollars.",1,1
"This was a gift for my friend who gets quite ""hangry"", so it was perfect! She loves it and stated it was the best gift ever. We really like that it is styled in the fashion of an emergency kit and can be refilled plus the refills can be purchased online. Great purchase and the company personally reached out to ensure we did not encounter any problems and to see if we had any questions. Excellent product and service!!! Hangry is a word that is often thrown around in our office. When I saw this product I knew it would be perfect for a white elephant gift. The product arrived fast, packaged well. The hard plastic box is very deceiving because it just looks like a first aid kit. The moment my coworkers realized it was a hangry kit full of goodies everyone wanted it. Three rounds later of exchanges we got to see the inside of the box. Good variety of treats organized well. Overall great experience and very satisfied! Love this  Hangry Kit in the to go packaging. I ordered for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift because he ALWAYS has snacks while he is on the job. He was stoked and impressed at the snack selection. (He is very picky, but said he would eat nearly everything in the kit). I will order again once this one is empty; probably try the next size up now that I know I can rely on Hangry Kits quality! I bought this for a friend of mine who is the epitome of the Snickers commercials and she loved it! It comes with a great variety of snacks and the box is a lot smaller than I expected, so very easy to transport and store. Got this for my boyfriend who is on the road in his car all day. He loves the variety and plans to re-stock it! Its already saved him fm HANGRY-tude several times. Gave this to a friend for his Birthday. He gets Hangry. I bought as a gift for a coworker and when she opened it she was so excited and so were my other coworkers. They all wanted one. Ask me where I got it. Great gift. This was a great gift. Family got a kick out of it. Would recommend/buy again.",1,1

"Absolutely phenomenal. Fit perfect. I have wide feet and have shoes like this from Crocs, Columbia, Steve Madden, Born and more.. These were great. Just dont wear on a rainy day. Hey dudes are the best.  Light weight and durable Love em! And so does everyone else! Compliments all night long on Christmas. They were a gift and he won't take them off. Been a Sanuk fan forever these are just different. great Love them.  Super light.  Not alot of support but i bought them for everyday casuals.  I wont be running in them so who cares i look good I wear a 11.5 tried these and they were a little small.  Gave them to my Dad and got another pair!  Get tons of complements! I love these shoes! Great relax shoe but run a bit large-1/2 a size",1,1
"We have older teen daughters that had a coulple of these when they were younger but that was a very long time ago. We moved on a cul-de-sac when they were in grade school and would walk it up the street and ride it down at crazy fast speeds with their friends. Thank God they didn't get hurt but they sure did have fun. I don't remember them ever tipping over. I just got this yesterday for my 3 year old son for Christmas. As others suggested, I purchased the polyurethane wiggle wheels for a smoother ride for in and out of the house. After opening the box, the first thing I did was pull up a YouTube video and watched how to switch out the wheels before complete plasma car assembly and that only took about 5 minutes. It would have taken less time but the back wheels were a little hard to remove. The rest of the assembly only took about 5 more minutes, so BRAVO to the makers of this product. Super easy assembly. Now on to the performance of the plasma car: All I can say is I love this thing. I rode it all over the house while my little one was sleeping before I wrapped it up. With the poly wheels, it doesn't make a sound. Super smooth ride, easy to operate and loads of fun for a 40 year old woman! I can't wait for my son to open this on Christmas morning so I can play with it again! Fantastic rider!... So fun if you have a sloped driveway, kids love it! This toy is awesome!  And your kids might like them too...  HA! I am overjoyed with what the plasma car has meant to our special needs child with spinal bifida! we were initally looking for something for our 6 yr. old daughter to be able to propel on her own when we came across the video on you tube for the plasma car. We decided to buy 3, one for each child we have here. Well, what a hit they were! Our 5 yr. old had no trouble getting the hang of it right off, our 2 yr. old granddaughter took a bit longer but loves it!  Our special needs daughter has been able to play for the first time ever, with the rest of the kids! She is mostly confined to a wheelchair and you can just imagine the elation that the plasma car  has brought to her & our whole family! We have been raving about it to anyone who would listen! Purchased this for my son's second birthday, and it was his absolute favorite gift by far! He absolutely loves riding it up and down the driveway and on the sidewalk.",1,1
"I originally wasn't sure which size to get (50-21-135 or 50-22-145) so I tried both. The smaller ones squeezed my head and the lenses were closer together. So basically if you have a small face/head, the smaller ones will work for you. I much preferred the larger size, they didn't squeeze my head and the lenses are bigger and rounder but they are proportionate to my face so they don't look cartoonish. I love them. Also, other reviewers mention a sort of rainbow tint on the lenses of many fake glasses. I tried both the ""gold fade"" and ""G"" models because they looked the same but in doing so also discovered that the ""gold fade"" do indeed have that rainbow sheen on the lenses.  But the ""G"" model doesn't have the rainbow tint and for that reason I much prefer the ""G"". Otherwise they are identical in style. I have posted photos of both so you can see the difference, it looks slight but it actually makes a pretty big difference, I found the rainbow sheen distracting. Good weight, not too heavy or too light. They feel like they were made for me on my nose, the arms are gold slim metal and the frame is obviously clear so they don't obscure or crowd your peripheral vision. The nose pads are what I think distinguish these from the rest, they keep the actual frame off your nose and just look nicer and allow for a better fit. Bit big on my little face but for most people they'd probably be perfect. Super cute and quality is good! I purchased these black floral frames, and i love them! They are so stylish, and I'm so relieved to see they fit my face. Usually round frames don't complement my face since it is so wide. So far everything looks good, hopefully they are durable as time goes by. TIJN Gold Fade 50-21-135 mm was exactly what I was looking for. Gold characteristic on clear frames definitely gives the glasses a very vintage, unique, and sophisticated look. I already got so many compliments from friends and strangers! I was not sure about sizing first, but based on other reviews I ordered 50-21-135mm and it was just perfect! In fact a little over sized frames make my face look smaller and they got the hip and chic look. Lastly, the packaging was legit - the glasses came in a sleek black case with a cleaning cloth and a soft bag. Overall it's an excellent product and now I am planning to get other styles :) Super cute accessory glasses. Pretty tight to the head and I have a small face so if you have a larger face you would either need to loosen them or pass on them. They are nice and heavy Cute. I had no issue getting my prescription put in. I get tons of compliments. Super cute! Came with a pouch and a little cloth to wipe them off. I’ve seen mall versions sell for double this price. Satisfied! I wanted to wait a few days to write this review, but I was too excited! These glasses are great quality and have a nice authentic feel to them. I was worried they might feel like plastic or something, but they are actually pleasantly heavy. Not too heavy that you have to keep pushing them up, but heavy enough that they feel real. They are a good size for my face (I guess I'd call myself a medium sized face). This is no glare in the lenses and they are as clear as day! (I forget they are even there!)",1,1
"Very cute, but one came broken off of the hook. I was able to fix it with some plyers. This was a welcome gift for the person who loves penguins. Just the right size. Super cute great quality! My daughter loves hers!! My sister in law really loved them thank you. Love them.  Really looks good. Doesn't hurt my ears. My daughter-in-law collects penguins, and these were so cute that I couldn't resist giving them to her for her birthday. SO beatuiful My wife loves them!",1,1
"It's a really sweet, girly belt. I love it. It'll go perfect with my dress. It's stretchy but I definitely wouldn't say this would fit everyone. This belt was EXACTLY what I needed! Its thin (but not flimsy) and simple. I was actually surprised at the quality of the metal part of the belt. As a ""cincher"" for baggy dresses or shirts, it's perfect. I wouldn't say it offers much in way of support but it's a thin waste belt and (arguably) not really meant to give support. My waist is about 27 inches and it fit perfectly. I'd say it would still fit someone 25-28 or maybe even 29 inches. But that's just a guess. It came in right on time and with no issues! Perfect for the Price! I love this belt - super cute and adds an extra element to any dress or blouse that doesn't naturally shape well. I have a large pear/hourglass figure, so this belt allows me to capture the narrowness of my waist, while still stretching enough to truly be ""one size."" My only wish was if the filigree leaf clasp came in silver. I wear mostly silver jewelry, so I need to either limit my jewelry on days that I wear the belt, or deal with the silver clashing with the natural gold/brassiness of the belt's metal detail. Still love the belt! 10/10 would buy again - would buy another if a silver one was created. ;) The hook that holds the belt together at the front is a little shallow to seem very sturdy, but it hasn't popped open on me yet. A very nice, vibrant color like the images. Nice quality for the price - it seems like Allegra K's belts are the one thing they do consistently well. Slightly tight on me, but I'm a size 10-14 (depending on manufacturer. Usually a 12). I wore it at the smallest part of my waist with a high waisted skirt and it looked super cute. It's very classy and has a very vintage feel. It looks great with so many colors. I've worn it now with a dress, many skirts, and a pair of high waisted jeans. The red is brighter than shown and also more elastic/tight than I wanted it to be...I imagined it would be more leathery and a darker/more classy color to wear with a black dress...but it's very bright an tighter so my skin rolls over it a little bit and it's too contrast-y with black. This was surprisingly cute.  Not expensive but narrow enough to go thru' loops on jeans that aren't MOM Jeans.  I use it a lot.  Has a feminine touch I haven't seen before. Very pretty and versitile since it's the belt itself is black elastic This is a cute belt, fits my average-sized waist, and is an incentive for me not to overeat. The belt does enhance an otherwise plain top.",1,1

"These fit beautifully. I'm rather fat and they fit great. I'm 6'5"" and 380 pounds... yeah I know I need to lose weight... but that's not what we're here for. These boxer briefs fit so veddy nice ah When I was a kid, the brand name men's underwear meant quality. Then They didn’t look excatly like the picture, by that I mean the name is the same, just how it’s written. I thought these would be little more bigger and longer for my legs, but no. They to me are like the ones I see at the store. Maybe it was a wrong item since I don’t see where it even said big/tall Quality fabric and comfortable to wear. My husband loves these and they look nice on him.  Fit is perfect. the support weakens quickly in the day. they start snug, but soon are loose. Purchased this item for my husband.  The fit him well and he has no complaints. Very comfortable",1,1

"This is a lovely ring to grace any hand! It is at once elegant yet simple. A beautiful addition to any jewelry collection. A must for anyone who appreciates Celtic art. This ring is  beautiful. I bought two of these for my daughter and she loves them. They are beautifully made.  I will be ordering myself some. This is cute I like it a lot, it's very pretty without being obnoxious. I using it stacked with a few other rings for a wedding band. Pretty, lightweight, simple filigree thumb ring. Just exactly what I wanted. Very comfortable.  Shipping and delivery was as promised.  Very very pleased! love it Great product, great price. True to ring size. I love it I wear it everyday Beautiful and at such a great price. It really is 925 and doesn't turn my finger green.

"My kids love these shirts, but they run very small! I ordered a boys 4, 5/6 and a 7 - just in case. My very petit 3 yr old fits into the 5/6 (he is 22 pounds and about 34”) My 6 year old just fits into the size 7 - he’s 46 inches tall and about 30 pounds. I may have to order him the next size up. I have not washed them yet and cannot comment if they shrink after washing. It takes a pry-bar to get this Ninjago shirt off my four year old.  He’s been running around in the cold with it on since Christmas.  The t-shirt has such good quality and the fit is good.  The colors are very rich and the t-shirt is soft.  I would totally recommend this t-shirt for any little Ninjago fan. My daughter is going through ninjago phase and I wanted to give her a tshirt that she could wear while playing. The material is good and the image is as is even after several washings. My Grandson, who we are raising, is having a Ninjago birthday for his 6th.  He will be SO excited to wear this on his big day. Uncle Gary was hero when the nephews unwrapped these on Christmas morning! My nephew Thomas is 5, probably about the same age as the child that manufactured the shirt. Color is good, fit is good. This will be a big hit for any ninja fan in your life.  My daughter loves to wear it!  Color is nice and vibrant. My 6 year old grandson loved it! Thank you! My son loves this shirt.  It looks nice, fits as expected.  He is 8 and I bought this for him knowing it would be a little big.  He never wants to take it off.",1,1

The Sneaks Came A Whole 3 Days Early Which Is A Plus! Great fit great product great price Just ordered the wrong size. Otherwise they were great Very satisfied with my purchase thank you all Love these retro DRod’s. Tried them on and they are comfortable to me. Customer Service is great, they sent me email updates on when the package was going to arrive even though my package arrived a day after from the original schedule day. The seller was more concern on me receiving my package and if I loved my new shoes, and I do. I bought these for pure nostalgia and ended up returning them due to them being a really tight fit on my feet.  Amazing design, but too tight and uncomfortable for me.",1,1
"Great musical toy for your kiddos and their parents!!! It was everything my mom ever wanted. It’s marketed for kids I believe, but my mom really wanted one of these things in tiny and this was perfect. Used this toy as part of my Weird Al costume, and it worked great. Really cute! Great sound.and good size for a young child will take awhile to lean to play. the kid loves, all i care about Bought for my son's Weird Al Halloween costume.

"My son is 5.5. He wore the hat and bow tie to school and then with gloves he wore for 4 hours at a carnival--he kept them on without a problem. He's a tall kid (90%) so I'm not sure these gloves will fit next year, but the hat and tie will for sure. I wish this costume came with an option to buy the tail. The rest of it fit well. The bow attaches in the back with a thin velcro strap--I might have to wrap it with material because it seemed alittle scratchy at first. The hat material is very thin--so I'm a little disappointed that it stains so easily. It come out with scrubbing with a rag and some water. But it's light enough so that my son didn't mind wearing it. So for 5-6 years old, it's probably fine. Any older and I'm not sure it would fit well if the child is much larger. But 10 + a tail for Halloween costume? Done and it was easy. Adorable! Bought this for my 6 year old son's storybook character day. The sizing was perfect and simple enough for him to take off and on by himself. Highly recommend! This item will be used at a Dr. Seuss themed baby shower. Guests will have the opportunity to wear the accessory kit for a photo that will be sent to them in their thank you card. The accessory kit is cotton and felt, and reasonably priced. It was several dollars higher at other retailers before tax and shipping were added. It arrived as promised in great condition. After the shower it will be used for a Halloween costume, so I will get an even better value for my money. A great buy. Hat , gloves and bow only ... all fit my daughter very well .  (Age 5) Very cheaply made but fine for dress up. Good Quality My 5-year-old son loves this. It's kid-sized; a bit big for a toddler, and too small for an adult. Pretty good quality for a costume item. GREAT ITEM WOULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN.",1,1
"Samsung seems to be having issues with their phones as of late, so I was a bit apprehensive about getting the S7 (despite no reported issues...yet). I'm happy to say that I love my S7, and I've been an iPhone user since graduating to smart phones about 7 years ago, my most recent iPhone being the 5c. Truth be told, I was pretty satisfied with my iPhone since it does pretty much everything you need it to on an easy- to- use interface and the reasoning for staying with iPhones exponentiates when you've got a MacBook or apple TV. Apple does a great job of keeping their herd in order due to compatibility issues if you step outside their technological bubble. However, after owning the S7 for less than a month and having dealt with ridiculously frustrating texting issues that are well documented problems for past iMessage users switching to android (makes me really upset I endorsed a platform that is so terrible to non-Apple users) I still would never switch back to an iPhone. The S7 is customizable, fast, easy to learn and use, and is a third the price of a ""comparable"" iPhone. It's also a beautiful phone whose screen is large, vibrant, and wonderfully touch responsive. I like everything about this phone when comparing it to my old iPhone. Also,  I promise I'm not a shill. I'm just so pleased to finally see that the alternative to my dead beat iPhone is as wonderful as everybody said it'd be. Hope Samsung sorts out their issues soon; I'd love to see more advancements being made to their wonderful line of handheld devices. Got my phone and had it up and running within 15 minutes. Got the fancy phone with frugal service. I purchased a cricket sim card to go along with this phone, upon arrival I went online to cricket wireless and set me up a new account, activated the sim, popped it in the phone as was able to receive calls immediately. Takes about an hour for you to be able to make outgoing with that carrier. If all other carriers are as easy to set up I recommend you purchase this device. This phone is not factory new. The box and plastic screen cover hand finger prints all over it. It was loose in the box. The data cord socket had scratches on it. BUYER BEWARE. I ordered a ""brand new"" Samsung Galaxy S7 from TimeToCell for my father for Christmas from the seller and within a month the screen started going purple and no longer worked. Because I didn't give it to him until Christmas, it was outside of the 30 day return window. However, having bought it ""brand new"", I figured the Samsung one year manufacturer warranty would be good, but NOPE! When I contacted Samsung they took my IMEI number and told me the one year warranty had expired in August 2017.... I bought the phone in November 2017.... I have tried contacting the seller two times and both times received no response.  Do not buy from this dealer. We bought this phone to replace a galaxy s4, I've waited a bit to do a review on it so we could break the phone in. We haven't had any issues with it, phone seems to work as any phone would, clearly works better than the old one. As another reviewer said, the phone is ""unlocked"" but still contains all the original AT&T software and firmware, which cannot be removed. Hi, the screen is not properly responding to touch. It is very difficult to perform press-hold on this screen. Several areas of the screen is significantly less responsive to touch as well. I am deeply frustrated as this is second time I am receiving a defective phone - I just returned my previous purchase due to some other screen problem. The Phone itself is great I love the Galaxy phones, HOWEVER, the description of item is so vague and inaccurate, I'm considering switching it, with all the annoying network compatibility issues it brought.",1,1
"While this thing is sort of cheap rickety plastic, it's held up well, and my 2-year old granddaughter is OBSESSED with it. She's put some serious miles on it as we walk the neighborhood, searching for people walking their dogs. I'm kind of amazed the wheels are still attached. It's also very lightweight, so when the kiddo gets tired of pushing it, you can tuck it under your arm. The ""groceries"" are a trip, sort of ""this is what Chinese people think we buy"" - juice milk? There are hollow, molded plastic produce items, but all of the boxes come as flat sheets which have to be folded, so have some scotch tape handy. I don't expect those to last too long, but she has fun sorting through them. There are three plastic eggs in a clear container, which she hands to me once we get the cart out - apparently she doesn't want plastic eggs in her cart? Who knows... This is exactly what I have been looking for . My son had so much fun with this shopping cart toy. It is very easy to set up without any instruction. Trolley is a nice size but I don’t think it will last long for few years as it is not tall . We called it a mini trolley . excellent  value for money .  We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 15month old and he hasn’t stopped pushing it around ever since. It was super easy to put together and came with a few grocery items which he likes to dump on one side of our living room, then pick up. I gave it 4 stars because of the cardboard food items. They didn’t hold up. The cart is made of plastic but it snaps and locks so it doesn’t come apart easily. Overall a great toy that he’ll get a lot of playtime out of. Got this as a cute toy for my daughter, since she is 17 months and now that she’s walking she loooves push toys. And she does love it, but what’s funny is that my 3 year old son loves it just as much. 😄 We get him to pick up his toys by giving it to him and having him wheel it around and throw stuff in. My kid likes this shopping cart toy. She is excited as getting it. It is easy to set up, just takes couple minutes. The height is appropriate to her, different fruits and vegetables make her happy. Also, she can learn how to recognize them. Easy to put together but a little on the short side , ideal for 3-4 year old children. The food was really cute and it came with a bunch of little paper boxes to fold together once I got the hang of we're pretty cool. Not as sturdy as I would like but my kids were happy. My 18 month old loves this! It’s really cute, really lightweight but it seems very sturdy. The food products are a bit disproportioned but it’s not like my daughter will notice. She loves pushing the cart around, taking out all the food then putting it back. It’s definitely a lot of fun for her. Very poorly made for a child.",1,1

"Oh happy days. One less thing to drive 17 miles one-way in to town to get because I let myself run out of laundry detergent. These are so nice to have have on hand - - I don’t like grocery shopping in the first place, hate the long drive, the parking lot parking madness and hazardous parking lot walking. I don’t like lugging these heavy items into and out of my shopping cart back out on to the check-out thing, into my car, out of my car, in to the house etc etc etc. I use Tide specifically for washing cloth diapers only. For all other clothing or textile items, I use a natural green detergent. I want to review this product specifically for cloth diaper users and I hope it is helpful for them. It's a great product. Make sure you pay attention to the size of these. They're tiny. I should have went to my laundry room to look at the one I had to see how many ounces that had, regrettably  I did not. (I am a single dad, it's only been a few months but I'm slowly acclimating to some of my new responsibilities, LOL) It's my fault, it probably isn't fair for me to give it four stars, but the reason I did is because I seem to recall when reviewing this product I was under the impression that these were large. If I made a mistake by not reviewing the item details closely, then I would give it five stars.  It's unfair to blame them for my stupidity. My favorite laundry detergent!  I am picky about scented products.  Too many scented items compete with one another and clash or give me a headache. Tide Free and Gentle cleans well without leaving the cloying odor of detergent on your clothes.  My clothes still smell fresh and clean, and this doesn't compete with my own perfume or products that I do like to use. I really like this laundry detergent. The size of the container is nice, not too heavy and this size doesn't seem to run down the side of the container like the larger bottles. was great Been using Tide since forever!  The only piece of legacy my mother left to me. A Box of Tide. Fear not Dear Mother My undies and other clothing remain clean and fresh smelling. Occasionally I slipped and bought other detergents but my forays down the soap aisle always brought me back to Tide.  I would look at the cheap detergent in my hand and gaze at the box of Tide. I knew I was cheating! But it was cheaper and on sale! Week after week of constant disappointment and dingy clothes. Laundry day was now a chore!  I thought a change was in order and I bought one of those HE front loading washing machines. Lucky Me! It came with a free sample of Tide!  Was I to be forgiven for my sinful  trepasses? I took it as a sign from the heavens (Fabric Softener)  But still I was ashamed to even touch a bottle of Tide out in the open where everyone could see my remorse and guilt. Now here on Amazon my orders come discreetly in a brown box with a smile.  Me and my Tide revel in the guilty pleasure of getting to know each other once more..  I will never stray toward that cheap stuff again.  My clothes so fresh and clean clean.  I know Momma is proud of me! TideTurbo Clean is the best detergent I've ever used.  I wash in only cold water, full loads, and only fill the cap to the ""1"" line  and this does the job.  This Tide rinses out better than the others. I couldn't smell any of the product's perfume on the clothes after washing them.  Our clothes have never looked or smelled so clean from any other detergent, including Tide with Febreze.  The price on Amazon Pantry is fantastic.  I'll definitely buy this again.",1,1

"I ordered 2 sixes because reviews were stating it runs small.  If you look at the sizing chart for big girls small is a 7/8 and medium is a 9/10.  I ordered both.  Small came as a 6X and medium was a 7/8.  Way too small both of them. VERY UPSET because we have to have these shirts for tomorrow at school. Excellent white tee shirt for little girls - the cap sleeves and v-neck make it so much more appealing than a giant unfitted ""boy's"" tee shirt.  Perfect for our needs.  I have no idea why the other reviewer didn't realize this was for children - but this is indeed for girls (mine are ages 7 and 9 and the Medium fit them perfectly). Pretty color and it fits ok, I bought a larger size to have room to customize the T but it's a slim fit, so it's fit to the body. If we'd bought the right size we would have been in real trouble. The shirt is fine but Jesus Amazon--fix the sizing chart! This is the second time I've had to return this item because the sizing chart is not correct! Nice shirt but sizing chart said large is 14 and when it came it said large 10-12 Ordered a size small,  as the size chart states that a ""big girl"" small is size 7/8. We need this last minute for a school project; the shirt runs very small and is thin.  It worked fine for a one-time use but not great after washing. OK quality -- but the sizing isn't accurate.  The sizing chart listed the medium as 10/12.  When we received the medium - the tag also said 7/8 on it.  We sent it back and are now awaiting the size large (which we are assuming will be the 10/12).  A bit of a hassle.",1,1

"This is a solid solution. It works perfectly and the case is very sturdy. I had purchased from best buy a Yoga 2 13 with a 128 GB M.2 SSD hard drive. There was a cheap piece of yellow plastic in the usb port which had broke leaving the pins exposed. Long story short, when not paying attention, I put the power adaptor in the usb port and fried the motherboard. I purchased a replacement Yoga 910 but was trying to figure out how I could transfer my information from the older ssd to the new without the hassle of cloning. I tried another transfer cable and it did not work. I then purchased the Eluteng USB 3  to NGFF adapter. It was exactly what I was hoping for. I inserted my old ssd and plugged the usb into my new laptop. It recognized the ssd and  I could easily drag and drop all essential folders to the new laptop. What a relief, all photos , music and saved passwords, bookmarks etc are restored. I am more than happy with this ten dollar purchase. I hope this helps all Lenovo  Yoga 2 13 owners with the 128 GB ssd drive who might have cooked there motherboards. My wife's windows year and a half old HP laptop's motherboard died.  We decided not to fix it but we wanted to get the files off her SSD hard drive.  I am a retired IT professional so I removed the hard drive and ordered this device hoping it would work.  It did.  Here is some advice for anyone using it for this purpose. I purchased this external case to use with a spare 512GB M.2 SATA SSD that I had. Installation was a breeze with the supplied screw driver. I used it with my 2280mm SSD but you can always use it with 2230mm, 2242mm and 2260mm as well, fully adjustable. I ran a speedtest with the new setup and the USB 3.0 was hitting 425mb/s transfer rate. I am using it with my 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro, working perfectly.  I love the overall size of this thing, great for traveling. At first I also had trouble as others had of trying to get the device to work on a Windows OS.  At first I put in a SDD M.2 card and attached the cable and plugged it into my USB drive and nothing came up my Windows File manager.  First thing you need is to plug it into a USB port that supports USB 3.0.  There are a few ways to determine this, the simplest one is to look at the markings on the side of the port.  If it's Marked with a USB drive marking with a double SS  just like you see on the cable then you should be good to go with that port.  I think it will work with a USB 2.0, but I connected first to a USB 3.0 port.  Once it is connected it will automatically load some drivers to support the Adapter.  You'll need to go into the Disk management and format the drive before it shows up in File manager and you can use it.  Click on the Computer on your desktop then select Manage and finally Disk Management under Storage. I needed an adapter to read a compatible M2 drive to recover data from a laptop before a customer sent the computer back for warranty service and this product made it easy.  I ordered it with next day shipping and it was in my hands less than 24 hours after I purchased it.  I was nervous that it wouldn't work based on some other reviews of it but it had no problems at all reading the drive I needed it for.  It is always nice to add another reliable tool to my tool chest. Turned the SATA III M.2 (2280 type B and M) SSD from my laptop into a new External Drive with this. That SSD was not functioning well in my computer, so I had to replace it. Very easy to use and it is all metal. Says it only works on B and B+M SSD's, so your NVMe Samsung 960 or similar SSD's (6-pin notch on the right only) will probably not work. The pictures explain it well. USB 3.0 Micro B in. Got Crucial MX300 1 TB SSD, bought to upgrade Lenova Yoga 700 which had a 250 G SSD.",1,1
"Finally! A cute, comfortable dress pump! I am so pleased with this shoe. I bought the nude and floral originally. I've now ordered the black as well. I had surgery on my right foot (first metatarsal fusion) Fall 2014. Finding any kind of a heel that can work for me has been so frustrating...until now. Because I now have a plate and seven screws in my big toe, I ordered a half size up so the pointy toe wouldn't cramp my unbending toe. Without this concern, I would have been fine with my regular size. I wore the floral ones all day, straight out of the box. Love. I have been searching for comfy navy blue shoes for a while now. I've had bunion surgery on both feet so I have to be real careful on what shoes I can buy and actually wear them. These shoes didn't need any break in time, it's soft leather and a cute kitten heel. The width is perfect 👌🏼, and since I have skinny legs ( flamingo legs) they look good not so bulky . I can be in them all day! I want to purchase the other colors now. These are my favorite Anne Klein shoes. I purchase them in every color I can get a good deal on. The shoe fits well. The leather looks and feels great. The insole is comfortable as iflex tends to be. The soles are non slip. I measured the heel on each of my shoes since different web-sites list different heights and they consistently measure at 1 1/4 inches. You can walk comfortably in the low kitten heel for a very long time and they look great with both pants and dresses/skirts. The shoes have a nice look to them and seem to be of decent quality.  It seems harder to get leather shoes at a reasonable price so this was a find.  I was going to have to try to make additional holes in the back strap so that they would stay on my feet, but decided it was too risky.  The toe seemed pointier than in the picture.  The bottom of the heel was on the small side so they were also a bit wobbly but then that could have been because they were a little too large. I ordered this shoe in 8 1/2 because I wasn't sure the narrow toe would fit.  The shoe was nice, but too large.  I ordered a replacement in size 8 and received a knockoff shoe.  It does NOT have the Anne Klein logo or branding.  So now I have to return and get a replacement for it.  If you order this shoe, make sure you receive a real Anne Klein shoe with the logo and iflex printed on the inside.  The replacement doesn't have any of that information on the box or printed on the shoe.  Very disappointed that Amazon doesn't check the quality of their products to make sure that knockoffs don't slip through :-( These are gorgeous little pumps - bright colors, great styling - that look like they would wear well.  Width and length were a little small.  Anne Klein shoes generally run a bit smaller IME, so I bought a 7M when I normally wear a 6.5B.  Unfortunately, I have a high instep and the top of the toe box cut into my foot when I took a step.  The material is stiff enough that I knew this would result in my carrying vs wearing the shoes....  Too bad - I really liked these and they seemed perfect for Spring! It is an attractive shoe with a great kitten heel but was uncomfortable on the outside toes, that is, too tight. I have a very narrow heel, but a normal mid foot. Since many shoes are similar in fit I could have ignored that for shorter periods of time, but every step resulted in alot of loud squeeking and other similar noises. It would definitely call attention in a restaurant or service of some sort. The sound effects may disappear over time once the shoe is broken in, but I did not wish to take that chance.  I returned the shoes. Normally a printed shoe might make for limited use but this fun shoe that actually works with many things in my wardrobe.  Seems to be true to size.  I love this style because the pointed toe is very flattering and yet comfortable for me.  The heel is just high enough for a feminine look without being hard to wear for more than a few minutes like all of my other shoes with heels are.  I have had good luck with Anne Klein shoes.  I would buy another pair if they had some in other colors I could use.",1,1
"I wasnt anticipating much, beings I only paid $5.99 for a dozen pairs of underwear. I was pleasantly surprised! They are good quality, comfortable, and they fit. I bought a large, and Im about six foot tall, 164 lbs. I usually wear a ten in womens. My only complaint is that it seems, like with many pairs of boy short undies i have previously owned, the front seems to ride a bit high, but I don't really notice it enough to not wear them, and they still feel fine. Its a pretty minor thing overall. So all in all, I think they are great, i would buy them again for sure Band around the leg doesn't stretch. If you have plumper thighs and butt you may find that the legs are tight and the back tends to be shorter than the front since they don't stretch. The patterned ones aren't a print, they're more of any iron-on feeling and make them even less stretchy. The quality of this product is ridiculously poor.  First, there was no consistency to the sizes, I bought one pack and in it there were pairs that were too large for me, and pairs that were so small I couldn't pull them up past my thigh.  For the ones that actually fit, and the large ones, they wore out or disintegrated with less than 3 wears.  Most had a rip or tear after the first wear; the most common being the seem around the top of it, but also the crotch would immediately have a hole, and I often noticed the legs would also rip - even on the pairs that weren't too small to wear.  Will never buy again and would not recommend! These are cute and inexpensive. Strangely, two of the pairs were tighter on my thighs than the rest... With the first, I tried to stretch the bottoms out with my fingers and accidentally made a rip on one side. I immediately changed into another pair and it fit just fine. I eventually went through the pack until I came to another pair that fit tight (this time I took care not to rip them, and just put them aside for when I might perhaps shed some pounds). I guess 2 put of 12 is not terrible(?) but sort of cheaply made as they are not totally uniform in size. The material is also very thin. You can tell that these won't survive too many laundry cycles. (You get what you pay for.) These are so cute, which makes me so mad that they don't work well. These were of very poor quality. The material itself was to be expected but the way they were put together was awful. The leg holes were much longer than appear in the pictures and the thread used to finish the edges was bound far too tight and very inelastic. The mere act of wearing them stopped blood flow through the entire leg. Not only that, but the elastic on top was barely sewn to the fabric. After a single wear it came apart from the rest of the material. I tossed them all. I am a larger person. So the reviews that do not recommend them to larger women.. i absolutely do not agree with. I will agree with sizing up one. Where the fit was good, a couple of the patterned ones were tight on the thigh. I just popped a few stitches and they fit fine. They are incredibly comfortable. Definitely recommend them (sized up if you are larger) and will buy again! Take special care when washing these babies...they shrink too.  So overall, I'd say order 2 sizes up if you like to wash and dry without having to working about shrinkage.  If you don't mind pulling these out of the dryer once the ""wet"" is gone, I'd still order 1 size up,",1,1

"Finally an electronic case that will hold everything I need! This looks a lot bigger in the pictures for some reason so at first I was surprised.  But this bad boy is small but mighty.  I travel every week and have yet to really find a good solution to the messed up, tangled up cord scenario.  This bag has so many different ways to organize and as a pure bonus, because I focus on organizing my cords every time I leave a hotel room- no more left behind cords or chargers.  Love this organizer.  Enthusiastic 2 thumbs up! Received item as described - thank you. This came in very handy in securing my iPad mini and ALL my cables for my trip to NY. Great way to organized and keep everything in one place. Thanks again! I love this bag. Zippers and stitching appear durable. Very stylish bag as well. Would help if it had a diagram or the display picture to show where everything goes. This kit is amazing and keeps me so organized Perfect size for all my cables, chargers, and power banks.  Definitely recommended. Awesome little tech bag, Makes organizing cables and miscellaneous items easy. Lots of space for a little bags.",1,1

"So, I got them as expected. On time. And the product was exactly what was described. Everyone said theirs were loose in the box, mine came the same way.. a bunch of loose earrings. I have trouble finding earrings that I can wear because my ears are very sensative. These were advertised as “hypoallergenic” and they’re definitely not.. it took about 4 hours for me to feel the irritation from them. There’s no way they’re 18k white gold plated.. my ears were on fire. Don’t buy them if you have sensative ears! I totally regret it. Although, if you don’t have sensative ears, it’s a great buy. This was SUCH a good purchase. I always find myself losing my stud earrings or losing the backs. Well now i have multiple sizes to choose from, extra backs for them, a cleansing cloth and a cute little box to house them all. I have sensitive ears and these have not irritated me once. Definitely would recommend. The earrings flew out of the box upon opening them as they were not secured at all. One of the earrings is missing and another was broken (the stone was out of the setting). The packaging seemed to be of better value than the product.... Beautiful earrings. I have super sensitive ears and over 12 hours in they havent bothered mw at all. Great buy! I have given CZ earrings to my daughters every year since they were teens. They look nice and you don't have to be worried if you happen to lose one. This particular set has a very nice box which makes for a great presentation on Christmas Day. I absolutely LOVE these earrings.Come with 6 pairs,every pair is sparkling,I have no need to worry about lossing my  earrings.I recommend these to anyone who can't afford diamond ones just yet.I get so many compliments on these and I'm going to buy more as a gift to my friends.Good quality,good price,would recommend! Fast shipping. these are a gift. However i love that they came with both the regular backs and the rubber backs. No issues with them at all they are extremely shiny too The earrings are great, super cute, but they arrived all loose in the super cute case. Disappointed in the product due to the lack of care with which they all seemed to be thrown in to the box.",1,1

"My phone was at 23% & took 1 hour and 10 minutes to fully charge to 100%.  Totally dont think this is fast charge. Charger seems original but the cable looks and feels slimmer than the original one that i got from the sprint store. the connection also feels tight when i connect to phone...as if its not the correct size. Hope it last long. This charger works perfectly with my Galaxy S7 and charges it fully in less than an hr!!!! CAUGHT FIRE the very first time we plugged it in and attempted to use! Now have to go out of my way to drop it off to return the blackened unit to get my money back. I'm not sure if we just got a defective one, or if it's not a legit Samsung product. It looks real, but I've had dozens of these types of chargers and never had one go up in flames before. Plugged in to charge a brand new S7 edge and keeps cutting in and out. Plugged in with factory S7 charger and no problems. Tried on my s7 and says it is charging... let is sit and ""charge"" and it drained battery from 10% to 7%. Does not work. I want my money back please! Product came bad out of box. Not working at all. I am asking refund right away! Stopped fast charging and it overheat sometimes after less than two months. I'm gonna toss it so it won't break my phone (happened to my S3 before). I honestly thought it was genuine. It troubles me that Amazon.com have their ""Samsung store"" sell accessories that are not genuine. Many people had the same issues in the review. I was in a hurry to buy a charger since I lost the one that came with the phone. Gave one star basically because it came white as pictured and it does charge my phone however it is not a fast charger. The wall plug does say ""adaptive fast charger"" so I will assume it's the cord that is not compatible. The reason i know its not fast charging is b/c when you plug it into your phone it says on the front ""3 hours until fully charged"". No way it takes 3 hrs, unless its just a regular charger. I bought this has a back up because my phone always dies at work so i do not use as my primary and didnt figure it out until it was too late to return. If you order please verify your phone is actually doing what it is supposed to. Otherwise dont ger your hopes up and just buy/use as a regular charger. I bought this set on October 8, 2016, and at the time of this post, June 24, 2017, the cable no longer provides fast charging for my Samsung Galaxy 7. Even when it did, it seemed somewhat sporadic depending on the outlet being used, I thought, but most likely due to this cable not being quite there in terms of matching the quality of the original charging cable.",-1,-1

"Anytime you can get cards ay a discount is a win-win to me.  It's the only time I buy them.  I wait until there're at least 10% discount.  Patience pays off. If buying gift cards, you likely know exactly what you're getting. 5-stars simply because I got a good deal. I really liked this 4 pack, as we gave them as gifts and were able to split them up. I received these gift cards with no money amounts on any of them.  There was supposed to be 10 dollars on each gift card which amounted to 40 dollars total.  This was not discovered until recently when my daughter first tried to use them.  How do I get reimbursed for them?  Thank you. Hey its iTunes Gift Cards... whats not to like about that?! VERY happy with how quickly the order came! The codes all worked. Free shipping, so it saved me a trip to the store. What else is there to say? I purchased these for a couple of my Grandchildren. I am sure they will love it I like how this itunes package has 4 $10 cards.  I can pass them out to my 4 kids!",1,1

"This is a great device considering the low price. It's not MacBook Pro, but it can really hold its own, and it's about one tenth of the price. I've tried other netbook-type devices in the past and they always had such limitations. This device operates just like a laptop, and allows the full functionality of MS Office, plays videos just fine, and allows for general Internet activities with decent performance and reliability. The keyboard is easy to type on, the screen is decent, it's lightweight yet feels fairly sturdy, and it's a device that just grows on you. After I first fired it up, I wasn't super impressed, but after using it a while, I am starting to really love it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants something for email, web surfing, watching videos, or even the full functionality of Word and Excel if you're a student or want to keep track of your finances. Cute and small fits perfectly in my handbag. This product is decent for everyday simple office work and travel it does everything my Dell D630 did only better with w/10  Screen is only an inch smaller each side its fast, prints and so far does it all that I could want in a notebook  The Lenovo Ideapad 110s is 2017’s answer to dirt cheap laptops from Lenovo. It’s only about $150 to buy, runs a full copy of Windows 10, hardly weighs anything, and has a nice keyboard – but it doesn’t exactly have the highest-end specs. Not going to lie 95% of the reviews had me worried. However mine showed up on time, with everything working. I've had no issues, it's perfect for all the simple things I need it for. This laptop is amazing I recommend for everything don't listen to all the other reviews saying it stops working I have had for about 1 month and it still works it's fast and doesn't lag in games fantastic little laptop. really looking forward to using it for classes and internet use.

"I love this ring! It is such a great statement piece. I'm happy I decided to purchase this ring. I had been eyeing it for some time and when it went on sale, I decided to get it. The stone is  a very pretty shade of green and I didn't notice any flaws. My fingers are fatter than the model so I'm not sure if it looks better on my middle or pointer finger; still deciding. This ring defiantly isn't for everyone only because it is a unique style with the large mineral for a ""gem"" stone.  Personally I love and wear it every day, great with jeans or dressed up.  Excellent quality and comfortable fit. It does sparkle in its own way. Okay first off I want to say this ring is gorgeous. It is different and has a glamorous yet earthy feel to it. The facets make it really sparkle and hard not to notice.  It does have some nice weight to it and appears to be well made. I put it on as soon as I got it and looooved it...however...upon wearing it for a few hours I took it off and saw that I had a greenish/grey ring mark around my finger. Im assuming this is .925 silver because it is stamped inside but what is this residue from? The pyrite or something else in the craftsmanship?  I'm a little disappointed since I have four silpada rings total and none of them have done this. I really like the ring but I'm on the fence and might return it. This ring is gorgeous!! I love it. The color and cut make it really sparkle. I love pyrite and had never seen it faceted like this before. Pyrite is a very dense and heavy stone but this ring is a good weight. Very comfortable to wear. Beautiful ring!  The ring is just as pictured and described..love the facets on the stone.  I didn't think it was too heavy weight wise and it seemed well made.  I had to return it only because I ordered a size 8 but received a size 6 in the package.  :( I love this ring! I love Pyrite and this one is beautifully faceted. I find this ring fits a little bigger This is a very large ring so long fingers are needed. It is a nice amber-green color. The ""stone"" had a few very tiny spots on the surface but these are not at all visible when you are wearing the ring. I wear it on my forefinger and it looks good there. The silver is very nice looking, makes the ring looks much more expensive than the ""stone"" setting.",1,1

"This shirt developed a hole after it's first use.  It is entirely possible that something may have snagged it and created a whole in the middle of the back.  However, I certainly do not recall running into or getting caught on anything that would cause this. The t-shirt did not shrink much in the wash.  This does have official WWE TM symbols, so, it does seem legit.  Sadly, Ronda has ruined the shirt for me. Classic!  Seems to be of good quality and print.  I've gotten a ton of cheap crappy shirts but this is not one of them. The large is way too small for me.  I am 6' 205lbs.  Should have gone with XL. Size is a bit off, fits small but otherwise, great quality shirt. Smiles on peoples faces when they recognize it is neat. A bit on the small side but son still loves this! My husband loves his shirt :) It fits exactly as expected, and it came quick. I ordered 4 different WWE shirts and this was the ONLY one that wasn't a cheap Chinese knock off.",1,1
"I generally wear a men's large. 42 jacket. I bought XXL, which fit perfect. the material is super thin and a slightly opaque. super comfy.  I'm getting the white shirt too Absolutely fantastic. My favorite shirt in a long time. I took everyone's advice and ordered a size up and it was perfect. Thanks. Super comfy. Not really for out side wear. Material is too thin and this really isn't a fabric you could finish well. If you're looking at this to wear around town, don't buy it...unless you're thinking you're the next Fabian I guess. Come to think of maybe I've seen guys at bars who might think this fits their style. i usually wear an xl and I went ahead and ordered 2xl.. fits perfect as I don't like snug shirts.. nice casual and yet a little dressy for those Where do I start? So I orderd a 4x as I am a girl boobed girl. When I received this shirt I instantly knew that the shirt was not a 4x at all. I even had a girlfriend of mine is smaller in both body size and boob size try it on. Now she normally wear med to large and low and behold it fit her perfectly. The over quailty of the shirt felt great as I have had other shirt like this one before but this one was a disappointment. Becareful when ordering. If you are built like the guy modeling the shirt, buying one size up is okay. If you are anything else, whether it be chubby, stocky, or whatever, your safest bet would be to order 2 sizes up. Which, to me, is absolutely ridiculous. I typically wear a XL so based on many recommendations I read here, I ordered a double X. The fit was not good at all. I'm quite certain I would have been pleased with the shirt had it fit as expected, but alas it did not. I'm 3xl.m, so I ordered a  4xl and fits perfect. The shirt is seethrou and delicate. I'll be washing it by hand. Other than that, is a nice shirt, Im happy with it. 4 only cause i have not washed it yet. usually i wash clothes BEFORE i wear them! chose to wear this first to get a feel for it so that after washing i know if it is consistent. know that i wash by hand, do not squeeze out nor violently wash them. they hang on a bamboo clothes dryer indoors so the sun does not weaken the fabric. i let them drip dry overnight if need be...",1,1
"As headline noted the lack of beads on backside is the prime reason these didn't receive five stars. I wouldn't mind as much if the back solid gold didn't show when wearing the earrings but it does indeed show even when the earrings aren't in motion. But the quality is lovely. No they aren't as full on the bottom as BaubkeBar but for such a small price It's still a very close tho not  identical look. Presentation was lovely in a box so well packaged and the earrings have the usual disk back as well as a thicker rubber tab to keep them more stable which is very much appreciated. I choose the red which isn't a blue based  red as it lean more orange red. Not full on orange but you do get a tinge of orange which does detract a bit from the strong red I wanted. But not enough of a distraction that I haven't enjoyed wearing them and receiving lots of compliments. First of all, One of the tassels is gold while the other is beaded turquoise.  The two earrings do not match at all. Also, the beading seems to have fallen off in some places on one of the earrings (see second picture).  I realize these were not the most expensive earrings but I might as will have thrown this money in the trash. Do not buy these I had wanted tassel earring for a specific event I was going to but knew i would likely only where them once. I liked the BaubleBar versions but didn’t want to pay too much for these type of earrings so ordered these similar ones on Amazon instead. These earrings were the right price point for what I needed and still a good statement piece. Took off one star because the back side on top has no black beads (see picture) but otherwise they were nice and not too heavy to wear. Plus the company packaged it nicely and sent a free bracelet with the purchase which was thoughtful. Purchased these pretty earrings for myself.I love the fact that it's like something different because they are beaded that are not heavy at all. I would definitely order more.There are so many colors to choose from. Hope you order yours soon. Great summer earrings Very happy with his purchase. The color is spot on but they are a little heavier than I expected so I would keep that in mind when buying them. Very cute earrings. A little on the heavy side. The back slips off and the earrings have fallen out. I’ve been lucky enough to catch it when it has happend but am now paranoid I will lose one at this rate. Need to find better backs for these These were a recommendation from Buzzfeed.  They are pretty good for the price! Cute - and I expect they will be nice with jeans/tee for a casual night out. 4 stars because they aren't finished all the way around where the beading meets the tassel - just halfway. Otherwise super cute. I got the turquoise - and they are a great shade. The company was lovely and sent a cute little bracelet as a thank you in the box - I love surprises! Was so sweet.  Anyway - these are a great buy for the money!  Enjoy!",1,1
"I mainly use this for my cell phones' quick charger, but have used it for my laptop and other devices. Runs very quietly and small enough to fit or even mount just about anywhere. Great for trips, both long and short. works great charges fast charge cell phones, runs laptop, and charges an accessory all at once. This is a great inverter from 12 volt to AC  110 volt for boaters, RV or working in the back country. It is light and well designed. Easy to pack and transport without carrying a bulky generator. Very good will power a laptop while charging your phone and tablet while going down the road. Kids can play their games, stream movies or watch a dvd all without a cumbersome inverter that would require running wires to your car battery. Connected to the battery, you can use a variety of small outdoor appliances, very convenient and practical. Quiet - I like that the fan only comes on if it is needed. Just what I needed Perfect size",1,1
"Just arrived. Got this as a Christmas present for my 6yo. Love it. I snuck the doll for clothes fitting and these were just the cutest! Fits with a little room to spare. I’m super excited to give it to her. Looks like great quality, should withstand her wear and tear. These outfits are very cute. They all close with Velcro.  You can’t compare the detail and quality of the clothes at American Girl with these.  For the price, these are well worth it.  FYI, some fabric dyes ( from non-American girl clothes) will transfer to the vinyl of the doll.  I always soak any non-ag clothes in a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water.  It sets the dyes in the fabric. Grandpa’s Christmas present for one of the granddaughter’s. She absolutely loved the changes of outfits. I admit I didn’t get to see all the collection but was informed she took the doll and outfits on her road trip to see the other side of the family. I was shocked by the quality of these doll clothes for the price! I was weary of purchasing because you never know what you will be getting, I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter has them hanging in her dolls dresser along with all her other doll clothes. She loves to mix and match the outfits and couldn’t be happier! Thank you so much! I ordered this wardrobe for my 10year old daughter whom loves to play dress up with her American doll, she absolutely LOVES THEM!!! I will be ordering more soon! The wardrobe is super cute and a great price for several different styles to dress the doll in! Gave this to my 7 yr old daughter along with her first American girl doll for xmas. She was so happy! The clothes were perfect and so much more affordable than AG label clothes, perfect starter kit and has kept her busy for hours None of the outfits actually fit the doll. I thought I was getting a good deal but I was just getting conned. I was confused because 8n the picture there is shoes with the outfits but it didn't come with shoes. I know I should have read product details. But should change the picture.....",1,1
"This is adorable. My daughter loves it. Adorable ring for girls. Absolutely beautiful! My daughter tried it on a couple of times and the ring got separated from the unicorn, it is very delicate. They’re so cute. I only wish they would’ve adjusted smaller. Omg so freaking cute I just love it got 2 as my little one asked the toothfairy for mood rings for her sister and herself. The rings come in pretty and perfect ring gift boxes to present these beautiful girl's ring. They are going to love them!",1,1
"Came in a plastic bag with all the Microfiber cloths organized by color.  Received 20 Microfiber cloths, 5 in each color, Yellow, Green, Orange, and Blue.  Recently used them to clean a computer case and it picked up all the dust with ease.  It also left the computer case which has a glossy finish spotless after wiping the case a few times.  Plan on using them to clean my car.  Would recommend for anyone looking for inexpensive, quality microfiber cloths that can be used for various cleaning purposes. PROS: Cleaning products certainly aren't the most exciting thing in the world, but dusting my dark wood furniture and glass stovetop with one of these and having NO FUZZ left behind is extremely exciting.  Fantastic!  I've used everything, including ones claiming to trap dust, and this is the best product for the value.  They're great to clean the tv screens and computer monitors (no chemicals, just wet the cloth slightly). I certainly wouldn't call these microfiber wipes. They look and feel like terrycloth. They are 85%polyester and 15%nylon This is a good value for a 20 pack.They are excellent quality and size for chores. Until now, we have had very little to do with microfiber rags. We could always find enough cotton rags and old towels to do the cleaning. But it was difficult to clean without leaving lint, especially noticeable on glass. That is not really clean. Microfiber does not leave lint and does not affect an LED screen if wiped softly.  I have used these on the TV, computer screens, keyboards, glass surfaces and wood laminate floors-all with great results. These would be a good value even if they were disposable. But being washable,  I would expect that these will doing their job for years to come. OK product ... not as thick as I thought it would be ... good for one time use on car with various cleaners and then disposable - recommended for light duty Work well. Good amount of cloths for the price. Towels themselves are great -- larger and thicker than the ""Best"".  I especially appreciate that the towels are vacuum sealed for delivery, resulting in a nice compact sturdy package easy to handle.  Even after breaking the vacuum seal by cutting a slice on one edge they stay pretty compact allowing me to pull out 5 or so that get put to use, then when those 5 are worn out, grab 5 more. Makes for  a clean, compact and neat way to store and dispense the towels. In the picture, I've already cut the package open and you can see it is still nice and compact.",1,1

"When I received this organizer I was concerned with the size but I just took a trip and was amazed at how much this little bag holds. I fit a number of charger cords, etc (my husband and I have different phones and IPads) plus my RavPower bank and it was not overstuffed at all. It has several options for storage, i.e. Elastic bands and large and small mesh pockets.  It easily fit in my tote bag and was so handy when charging was needed. I love this little bag and highly recommend it I saw these pouches in an ad and immediately bought three, 2 as gifts and one for myself.  I ordered one in each color.  They are exactly what a traveler needs to manages all the power cords for all the electronics we carry around. I can see it being very useful.  My only complant is that the green color was not what I expected.  The picture lead me to believe it was more of a light greed, when it fact it is more of a darker olive green.  The blue pink colors do appear as advertised.  This is minor  and I do intend to keep the green one. I'll start with the bad news. I ordered the blue as pictured but in reality it is a dull navy which is not pictured.  The 'power cable holder' is not evident ... but unecessary as a selling point anyway ... its a toiletry kit for heavens sake. This might be a fluke, but the bag I received has some white staining/scuffing on the bag, as if it were used previously, then returned, then shipped to another buyer without cleaning. Buyer beware-you may get a used bag. cute and handy case, Holds a lot of stuff.  Good price. Ty I needed something for traveling when I go home to visit the kids and this fits the bill for my toilteries and other things. Love the color too",1,1
"We have now been using this set for 6 months.  When we first received and began using them, the pans were perfectly nonstick so that food including eggs could be cooked without any oil, and cleaning was fast and easy.  Unfortunately this is no longer true -- the pan we've used most often now requires oil in order than food doesn't stick, despite hand-washing and following the manufacturer's other directions.  If no oil is used, the pan is like a traditional pan and not only does food stick, but the pan requires prolonged soaking and scrubbing to get it clean.  You must also be careful not to stack the pans (chipping and scratching). At first I loved this set, and still do.  There is a terrific heft to the pans, so you can feel the quality.  Pair them with a gas stove and food cooks three times faster than with cheap pans and electric. I read all the reviews on this eco friendly Cuisinart 11"" grill pan and decided to purchase it. First I will say, it is a very good looking pan.  I have only used it three times so far so maybe in 6 months I will have a different opinion but it is everything the manufacture claims.  I have an electric smooth top stove so I was worried that it might not work for me as it isn't entirely flat on the bottom. It has grooves.  Much to my surprise this pan fits perfectly on my cooktop.  The handle stays cool and it grills very nicely leaving nice grill marks.  Clean up is probably the best part as it cleans up beautifully without any effort.  After reading other reviews, I decided not to grill on high and only have put it up to medium and medium high at the maximum. I also let it completely cool down before washing it by hand in warm soapy water with a sponge or paper towel.  This pan looks  brand new like it has never been used. I also took care in having the pan in drawer where it does not touch other pans as it could chip the ceramic material if other pans are stacked on top of it.  I am hoping this pan continues to hold up after months of use.  If it does, I will say this material that the pan is made of is the BEST INVENTION EVER.  The pan is also relatively inexpensive.  At less than $50, you can't go wrong.",1,1

"I wanted a portable hand held steamer and started my research.  After reading a ton of reviews it appeared I was going to have to buy 2 hand held steamers.  One to do curtains and garments upright - and another one to do flat items like bedspreads or a garment laid out on a table, etc.  Until I finally ran across this one.  When I received it I immediately tested it out on upright and flat laying garments and a bedspread that was on the spare bed.  It worked great in all positions, even upside down !!  No leaks, wet trails or water spitting.  Now, I don't use a steamer that often and only used it once so far but it did all that the description claimed it would do. This is the best steamer for clothes I 2ever used! I like the light weight, long cord, it sits nicely in hands, steaming works very well and what's very important for me is it's NOT LEAKING! I had bad experience with portable clothes steamers and for a  long time was looking for some good one and finally found it!!  Thank you seller! UPDATE 4/25/17 OK ... I must confess that I DO LOVE TO IRON . To me it is cathartic & my time to just do a rather mindless task & just BE. I purchased this clothing steamer for an upcoming trip. This steamer is advertised as ""No water spitting"" and ""No wet trails"" and that is what caught my attention. A different brand that we purchased many years ago used to leave all kinds of water spots and lines. This Bizond steamer works as advertised! No spots or lines. It works really well in removing the wrinkles that sometimes appear on clothes being removed from the dryer. I found that many times the ""wrinkle resistant"" and ""no iron"" shirts would have enough wrinkles on them that they really needed to be ironed for a touch up. I found using the Bizond steamer to be a quick fix in removing them. I don't want to imply that the end result looks exactly like an ironed shirt, but it does such a great job that they are now wearable with little effort. It is advertised having a 2 year 100% warranty. You can't beat that!",1,1
"Awesome shirt, bought this for the Disney Cruise Pirate night and everyone loved it. Quick shipping and exactly what I wanted. Love this shirt -- instant costume & always gets comments -- especially on the faux chest hair.  Comfortable and fits as expected.  Add a hat, some rum, and you arrggggh ready for a party. This was a hit - decent quality - perfect for the pirate in your crew who isn't too keen on costumes. Love the graphics on this. The bird and the chest hair look real. I guess the 2X fit as expected. I’m glad I didn’t buy the size smaller though because the shirt does not stretch. Everyone thought the chesthair was real! Hilarious fake hairy chest on this t-shirt. Made a great Halloween costume when paired with a 3 cornered hat, a sword and some over-the-shoe fake boots! This shirt looks great - the colors are bright and it has a lot of detail. My hubby wore it for a pirate-themed race and got a lot of compliments. This is the second one I purchased for my husband.  So cute and real looking.  Every one likes them.",1,1
